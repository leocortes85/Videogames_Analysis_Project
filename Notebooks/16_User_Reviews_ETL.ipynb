This games soundtrack is fully orchestral and imersive. The music just fits perfectly where-ever you are in game. Whether you are spelunking or just flying through the vast expanse of space it fits perfectly and leaves you in awe.Ok onto the graphics: The look and feel of this game bring the vast worlds to life with the many colors and alien dirts, trees and the mixture of monsters. The backgrounds of the planets match up the the foregrounds well and give the 2d aspect that 3d feel.Now the gameplay: Starbound has a nice rich layer of gameplay revolving around survival. In the latest unstable build updates they have introduced a very needed layer of missions and npc quests which fullfil the gaps of just flying from planet to planet and give purpose.Starbounds worlds have a wide variety of random aspects to them.First off the flora: Flora of planets consists of 2-3 main aspects. The Trees, the small bushes and medium bushes. Each planet has a vast difference to the next in their flora with trees coming in 2-3 different types from metallic trees to plain out alien tentacles.Now onto the fauna: Each planet has 3 or more ground based animals which increase in strength further beneath the planets surface. Starbound has a feature where animals are customized via their limbs and body. There are many arms, legs, feet and bodies all just jumbled to together from monster to monster making cute monsters and just plain out terrifying ones. There are also around 2 bird species per planet. Using the same general system.I personally suggest this game because of its deep and fluid experience and its wide modding community.8-9/10 for an early access and its only going to get better!"}]},{"0":"devvonst","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/devvonst","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","item_id":"440","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted February 12, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"Best first person shooter"},{"funny":"","helpful":"0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","item_id":"218740","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted February 9, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"Well, need a multiplayer option"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"550","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted October 31, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"AWESOME"}]},{"0":"Fr0stedLine","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fr0stedLine","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"220","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted February 27.","recommend":true,"review":"Hermoso juego que nunca olvidare <3"}]},{"0":"starkillershadow553","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/starkillershadow553","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","item_id":"238090","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted February 4, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"One of the best sequals i have every seen, rebellion dose a great job of refining and improving. the X-ray mechanic is vastly improved.One thing in particular i dont like is the new leveling system and having to unlock weapons, but then again it gives the game massive replayabily through the open-ended levels making you want to go back for more and get those weapons, but personal opinion i like V2's weapon unlock system.great game worth every dollor, 9/10"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"242130","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted August 23.","recommend":true,"review":"If you're looking for a no frills, Arcade/Simulator Style Dog fighting game you have come to the right place."},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"277430","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted April 5, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"For $5 this game is worth your time.Pretty easy to pick up and play with simple controls and fun gameplay. dont be worried that the game will be runied by microtranactions cause they dont really change the game at all.Graphics have a really nice feel the them and sound is really good.Hopfully this game will pave the path for future halo games to come to PC."}]},{"0":"76561198058373434","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058373434","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"8870","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted January 8, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"1.

With the help of the hl2 engine, the graphics, models of weapons and characters, this deserves one of the best shooters game of all time. As well as this, map-making is avaliable to all people who are willing to do it, same with plugins for custom servers, Source Film Maker and many more things. This is overall a stunning game that I have played for a while and deserves a yes. GG Valve.Some things that may put it down, however, would be the fact that some recent updates are very similar in terms of style. For example, the Gun Mettle update brought in contracts, new maps, etc. The halloween update brought in the same thing, but just different missions.People who play other shooter games, that are like COD, Battlefield, etc. One thing i would have to say to those people would be, don't shout at the medic to run to you and specifically YOU because apparantely YOU are the one carrying the team with your gibus and goggles and your natascha, family business and your eviction notice. Pub doesnt work like that, sunshine.As well as this, don't be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to the new kid or some ♥♥♥♥ just because you got screwed over when you were new. At some point this new kid will have a better inventory, (yes i know just because having an expensive inventory doesnt make you a better player) better items, and a better fighting style. TF2 doesnt need those kinds of ♥♥♥♥♥ on their servers.Either way, although there are some parts of the years to come that will be lazy, there will be better things introduced. Frankly, i want some new weapons, they've been just introducing reskins. Example, Batsaber.Yes."}]},{"0":"76561198070194565","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070194565","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"0 of 11 people (0%) found this review helpful","item_id":"233250","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted October 9, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"на каком компе пойдёт эта игра ана лагает "},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"449140","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted May 7.","recommend":true,"review":"отличная игра скажу вам и расскажу о ней в плюсах и минусах плюсы+щикарная графикастрой всё что захочешь (например рокет лаунчер который как миниган)боты естьминусы- нельзя больше 6 игроков надеюсь добавят больше игроков не 3 на 3 а 4 на 4 и тд тпмоя оценка 9/10 (будет 10/10 когда сделают побольше игроков)"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"368730","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted May 7.","recommend":true,"review":"ребята ищю игроков которые со мной будут играть в эту игру"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"246280","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted April 4.","recommend":true,"review":"отличная игра советую всем только жалко что тут донат есть"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"427270","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted March 30.","recommend":true,"review":"все кто не советуют эту игру они либо не фонаты доты 2 либо ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ы я лично обожаю эту игру были 2 части появилась копия доты ну 2 режима 1 режим наш всеми любимый дефенд и 2 НОВЫЙ  режим доты только с ловушками мне очень понравилось! она пока ещё в бете НО ВЫ ОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНО ДОЛЖНЫ ПОИГРАТЬ пусть и донат есть НО ЭТА ИГРА ЩИКАРНА ! ну и теперь приступаем к плюсам и минусам !! плюсы+отличная графика 2 режима много вещей (от беты такое не ожиддано) минусы-мало игроков4 плюса и 1 минус надеюсь вы скачаете эту игру и добавите меня в друзья будем в месте оборонятся или в режим доты 2 пойдём :)"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"397100","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted March 28.","recommend":true,"review":"игра хороша но единственный минус КАК ЭТО ВСЁ ПОСТРОИТЬ??! да да это и есть минус я не понимаю НЕ КАПЕЛЬКИ как построить меха так и летаю на самом первом выдающемся кубике надеюсь в эту игру добавят workshop ибо СТРОИТЬ ЭТО УНРИАЛ надеюсь всё таки будет воркшоп и гейб или ещё ктото там договорится с японцами и сделают workshop ибо   у меня на нет получается ну я ни капельки не понял как построить меха или ещё когото чтобы он смог двигаться бегать прыгать летать (хотя я знаю как заставить летать) моя оценка 8/10 будет 10/10 если добавят workshop"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"248570","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted November 9, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"ну прикольная игра но 1 минус сложно делать приёмы еслиб можно было создавать приёмы и в инвенте снарядить чтобы просто бить этим приёмом"}]},{"0":"Rivtex","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rivtex","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","item_id":"298630","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted December 23, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Its so bosss"}]},{"0":"UTNerd24","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UTNerd24","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"244210","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted May 6, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"This game has TRUE potential to be something of legends.Even though this game isint completed yet, It's current state has amazing things to offer.It wont be too long before we go from Drag racing BMW's to Racing a Bugatti Veyron SS around the Nurburgring...But well have to wait and see.Highly reccomend this game!

When all slots are filled it's highly balanced. It's controls are responsive and nothing beats sniping a shark while hanging upside down in the corner with a harpoon.The only problem is the AI. In a game where majority of the gameplay is based off line of sight, and moving without being seen, an AI really destroys it. They can always see you, and never miss as a shark or a diver. They ruin any game almost instantly, but besides that, it's worth buying it when it's on sale.Not entirely sure if it's worth paying full price however, as that's around $80 for you and 3 other friends. And it isn't completely worth paying full price for it."},{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","item_id":"333930","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted June 26, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"With the golden rule \"Don't be a ♥♥♥♥\", how could you go wrong?"}]},{"0":"76561198087407319","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198087407319","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"440","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted January 15, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"Otimo game"}]},{"0":"76561198056741844","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056741844","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","item_id":"730","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted October 14, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"คุ้มกับที่ซื้อมามันส์มากครับ"}]},{"0":"sad-commie","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sad-commie","2":[{"funny":"2 people found this review funny","helpful":"2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"294100","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted August 31.","recommend":true,"review":"This game killed my social life and the mods hauled it to the granite crematorium."},{"funny":"","helpful":"3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","item_id":"212070","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted July 9, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"I's freaking rad and the ingame graphics are wonderful.

This is not the case. This game is genuinely a masterpiece and i have never played a game that made me feel so many emotions that range all over the spectrum, i mean hell I thought The Last of Us was emotional as hell. one minute its happy then desparation then wanting to cry like a baby (points in the game specifically made me question my manhood due to how much i was trying to not break down like a baby) this game honestly does show alot of great points that are true in real life as well, like value those close to you and despite this being the internet and it not being known to be shown but, showing compassion and taking the time to give a helping hand could possibly save someones life. It is funny that a troll on tf2 would find such a great love and change of perspective from a game, call me names call me what ever the hell you like.

From all the time I spent with FO3... I never could have imagined this garbage is what you'd spew up from the depths of whatever 'creative' hell it came from. I thought you would learn from what Obsidian did with New Vegas, more depth - more REALISM.The map is smaller than Skyrim, Todd. Not in length, or width, but in the sense that the little things are missing. The special touch and charm that is just on the cusp of every corner you'd turn in the previous fallout titles is missing... The environment feels hollow, too vibrant, too smooth. It's not the same Fallout theme I grew to crave and felt wonder at. You traded something original, something special, from those wonky shooter mechanics to the skill bar and karma system, for what? better FPS mechanics and a more 'console-friendly' interaction system? I would suggest that all digital copies are wiped and the physical copies piled into a garbage dump like Atari did when E.T. the Extra Terrestrial failed... but I digress...This game should serve as a warning to those who find themselves with an IP as significant as the Fallout Universe. It's like they say - \"IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT!\" Do yourself a favour and buy Fallout: New Vegas, instead of this $80 squirming feeling of regret and hopelessness."},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"440","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted January 15.","recommend":true,"review":"I spent way too much time on this game early on in highschool, may or may not have led to me dropping math as a subject. Besides that, this game doesn't feel the same as it did 5 years ago. In my personal opinion the new content  scheme they've borrowed from one of their other games, CS:GO, shows a stark indication of how much damage the newer updates have wreaked on the TF2 community. The new guns/skins look awful, it's a transplant from CS gone wrong. It's a lot more toxic, and competitive in TF2 now, F2P destroyed the quality of an already degrading player base. Idle and achievement servers fill up the server list completely. TF2, we had a good run... but now it's time for this grizzled mercenary to hang up his hats."}]},{"0":"Coldaniel","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coldaniel","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"35450","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted March 22, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Great Game Loved Every minute playing"},{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"440","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted August 21, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"EXECELLENT GAME GIVE 10/10 NEVER STOP PLAYING IT:-)"},{"funny":"","helpful":"2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","item_id":"236390","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted March 13, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Great Game been playing for nearly 2 years and enjoying every minute of it Keep it up!10/10"}]},{"0":"therealmorty","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealmorty","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"351570","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted March 20, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"I liked it, the zombies were pretty bad though."},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"212680","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted March 7, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Got angry at it. 11/10"}]},{"0":"Berserklejerker","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Berserklejerker","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","item_id":"391540","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted October 10, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Is Bretty Gud, Date a skeleton who loves spaghetti.

So at first i wasnt so keen on ubisoft relaseasing another game so shortly after Unity, which i think i speak for everyone, despite an attempt at a next-gen engine, it was still average at best. Rogue to me feels like im playing the best bit of the AC franchise, The ship from AC4 and the same unchanged New York map from AC3 to name a few. Some elements from previous multiplayer have also been added in, despite there being an actual multiplayer. My main attractions to Rogue would be the tie-ins to other parts of the franchise, the expansion on the Kenway saga from Black Flag, the Birth of Achillies and his part in AC4 (seems like a sequel, Fast and Furious flash back anyone, *cough* Han *cough*). This also raises another issue i have however, these connections seem very much like Ubisoft are tying loose end to the AC4 and AC3 series, which we saw happen in revelations. Obviosuly this game is far better than Revelations, but is it? im not saying rogue is a cash cow but if the same thing is happening again and ubisoft are working on something in the background, Rogue is nothing more than a slight o' hand (see the pirate reference?), a very visually appealing one at that, they went pretty hard out with this one, even if it is just tying up loose ends and mamking the whole Benjamin Franklin and Achilies issues seem more realistic, it was worth it. Touching on that further, despite being released after PS3/4 and XB360/1, Rogue also had a lower realease cost, which also leads me to believe there is more in store for his franchise, this is in no way the end, ubisoft opened a can of worms by releasing the Templar play with Shay and i personally think it will breathe new light into a somewhat dying franchise.Some things i disagree with:- Bring back the crouch, creates a better sense of realism, i literally walked passed enemies and no one even battered an eye lid. (not legit)- Bring back multiplayer, even if it was only the sailing, i would play that for hours. Seriously, that would have made this game epic. - Hunting is no fun, i dont know anyone who enjoys the hunting challenges.Give this one a go, if you liked the ship from AC4 and Black Flag then its even better here Rogue, Also there is less \"land play\" which made me happy.Have to congratulate Ubisoft here, well rounded game, stable enough for a PC version of AC, playable and enjoyable. P.s Dont take the ship away again.Cheers,Lordelicious."},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"322170","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted January 7, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Awesome game, very addictive and truely immerisve.

It was fun, pretty buggy, but it was full of promise. Skip forward a few years later. The game is worse. Lets talk about starting the game. The game is slow to start. Starting a game will take just as long, and when you get into the game itself, prepare for unoptimized slowness. The game runs terribly, is riddled with bugs and the devs generally don't add any new content. If this was developed by a good indie team, or an AAA team (Oh, did i forgot to mention they fired several people who worked at Bioware, and hired some scrubs?), it would be amazing. The concept is great, I would have really looked forward to this game shining, but the devs are horrible.

Es allí donde se encuentra el Cristal “GG-3883”, un mineral del planeta Xen que fue capturado para una investigación. Cuando todo marchaba “normalmente” ocurre una pequeña tormenta de portales dentro de la cámara de pruebas seguido de una gran explosión que afecta a todo el sector. Freeman, después de despertar, no solo se encuentra con científicos heridos y/o muertos, sino también con la fauna de Xen que viajaron atreves de una brecha dimensional. Al ver la situación de emergencia en la que se encontraba no solo el sector, sino también todo Black Mesa, inmediatamente sube a la superficie abriéndose paso entre los Xenianos pero al llegar se encuentra con las fuerzas especiales H.E.C.U. que están “silenciando” a todo el personal de Black Mesa y eliminar todas las pruebas del desastre. Al ver la situación, Freeman se mueve a través de todo Black Mesa para llegar al Complejo Lλmbda y cerrar la brecha dimensional antes de que se extienda por todo el mundo…Jugabilidad...Hλlf-Life es una verdadera obra maestra cuando nos referimos a él como un juego “Single Player”, el objetivo del juego es utilizar pensamientos lógicos y nuestro armamento para sobrevivir en un entorno lleno de enemigos con distintas habilidades, también hay situaciones en el que los puzzles (al menos en los primeros días) pueden llegar a ser un problema.Variedad...El arsenal del juego que es muy variado desde armas simples como la Crowbar, Clock 17, Mp5 y Spas 12, hasta armas potentes, tanto militares, experimentales y alienígenas. No es lo único en variación, también hay una gran cantidad de enemigos como los soldados H.E.C.U., las asesinas Blacks Ops, alienígenas de distintos tamaños y poderes e incluso los guardias de seguridad si llegas a causarle heridas intencionalmente. Y la música no se queda atrás, cada escenario tiene su propio ambiente musical que puede generar tensión o adrenalina en el jugador.Innovación...La interacción con los NPC, el modelado y sus animaciones, para su época, eran sorprendentes, a pesar de que en ciertos momentos pueden sufrir de glitches. Los gráficos de ese momento, los efectos de luces y sombras, diseños del entorno y la ambientación, Hacen que el jugador realmente sienta que está dentro del juego, esto es gracias a su motor GoldSrc, una versión modificada del motor Quake.Multijugador...El multijugador de Hλlf-Life tampoco ha quedado de lado, su gran variación de armas, los orificios de bala en las paredes, salpicaduras de sangre o mejor, despedazar los cuerpos de los jugadores, la posibilidad de crear servers dedicados, la gran variedad de mapas incluyendo los oficiales y los que fueron creados por la comunidad, los personajes para controlar aunque en este aspecto hay pocos, aun así el jugador puede agregar más personajes al multijugador aunque los demás jugadores no tendrán la posibilidad de verlo.Mods...Como último punto, el motor GoldSrc, es un motor fácilmente manipulable, tanto que se han creado  varios mods del juego, como los más conocidos como Counter-Strike y Team Fortress, hasta los más olvidados como Deathmatch Classic y Ricochet, aunque estos son mods oficiales, la comunidad ha creado gran variedades de mods como USS Darkstar, Azure Sheep y Sven Coop.Puntos Negativos...Los únicos puntos malos del juego son que en el viaje del inicio es muy largo, aunque esto se puede omitir con la consola, la poca variedad que hay con los aliados, que son solo un científico con cuatro modelos de personajes y un guardia de seguridad, las armas y enemigos de la versión βeta que no aparecieron ni siquiera en el multijugador, y el no incluir la campaña especial “Decay”, un modo de juego exclusivo de Play Station 2 que permite jugar con 2 científicas.GAMEPLAY:             SOUND:                HISTORY:               INNOVATION:★★★★★          ★★★★★          ★★★★★          ★★★★★DIFFICULTY:            GRAPHICS:              DURATION:             TOTAL:★★★✩✩          ★★★★★          ★★★★★          ★★★★★http://store.steampowered.com/app/70"},{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","item_id":"359550","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted April 15.","recommend":false,"review":"Me sale un error de NAT estricto y me da paja configurarlo..."}]},{"0":"TeCool","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeCool","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","item_id":"274980","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted December 15, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"I'd definitely recommend this game for people who want to expand their vocabulary, but there are a few things I'd like to point out.-While this is almost never required for romance languages, in Japanese, Chinese and Korean, words, Especially adjectives and verbs, can be synonymous but imply different things. This is almost always the case in Japanese, where verbs have transitive and intransitive forms, but this is not listed in the definition, only one form is presented. This means doing research on the word you'll find yourself using more will help you be more fluent in the long run.-So much katakana... I'd like to see really rare kanji forms of words, as they can appear in stories and some videogames (You know, like English games using the words, 'Thee', 'Thou', etc. They're rare because of their age, but they can still find a use in medieval style games!). In fact, I might prefer it that way as I want to learn as much words as possible and converting English to katakana is easy when you learn about how Japanese pronunciation works. Just add a note to say it's rare to avoid confusion.-Some objects are... Odd. I saw this red box and the definition said it was a piggy bank or something, I was confused until I saw a dial, which meant it was a safe. Maybe you should make objects cliched/stereotyped and exaggerated to help people understand with a quick glance.-It doesn't follow spaced repitition, so you can mash the replay button endlessly until you get yourself a star. If you're a serious learner, never press the replay button, as you just bring it back to your short term memory and fail to remember it the next few days, at least space the replays by an hour the *first* time you try it.-Lists make it too easy sometimes, avoid using them and just use the random button, as I found myself just clicking whatever's next to the last object I clicked on, as I was able to remember the next thing I added right after. This is a mnemonic that relies on the location of the object INGAME, so it doesn't really help you learn. If you really want to do lists, run around the whole house clicking random items and adding them to the list, avoiding any sort of order or pattern.And here's some tips for Japanese:-Avoid Romaji, in fact, do kanji, when you don't know a word, you don't know it, there's no improving your ability to decipher meaning from kanji, so just dive right into it. Do kana if you're really keen on learning pronunciation before reading, and want to do it really, really quickly. Same thing probably applies with Pinyin and Hanzi, but I haven't played  the Chinese version so I don't know if Pinyin is provided.-The dots that appear between kana when you look at how to read the kanji is important, memorise the kana in sections divided by the dots, and their associated kanji (e.g. (毎日 [まい＊にち] まい is 毎 and にち is 日)) This is important, words might have multiple readings, and you might get them wrong, but if you memorise at least ONE reading for the kanji, you can type it on a computer, and even get the correct reading by typing the kanji on a dictionary.-While katakana is easy when you know it well enough, sometimes it isn't, as you might say different versions of a word (E.g. Fairy Floss vs. Cotton Candy, (Well, it's neither when translated to Japanese, but you get my point!)) or it's just katakana but isn't based on English, (e.g. パン for bread). Either way, it's nice to learn a ton of katakana in this game as you get badges for it.Other than that, it's good as you'll find objects in an every day home, and the exploration stops you from being bored quickly, and most importantly:It makes you think of (and therefore associate the word you're learning with) objects and pictures, rather than the English translation, which means that you can achieve fluency which allows you to form sentences in the language you want in your head directly, rather than creating an English sentence, translating it to your wanted language, THEN saying, writing or expressing it."},{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","item_id":"202090","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted December 6, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"Best game ever, very little P2W, as all payable items actually can be detrimental to your playing skills, an expert who started with bad equipment will have more potential than a new player who uses very high level equipment, as he'll be used to it and fail really badly when there's an event that measures skill only and gives people similar equipment. Also, all high level equipment are sorted by level, so if you can't buy it with ingame currency, it means specialising isn't a very good idea until you get to a higher level. Payable items don't have this restriction, so very powerful equipment can be put in the hands of new players. Keep in mind that all equipment has a bonus, but an equal penalty, making it not \"powerful\" in a linear sense, but if you specialise in a way that suits your playstyle, it makes you more powerful (but doing this early can bar you from changing your strategy and trying new techniques.)In terms of gameplay, everyone is -mostly- equal, some more general and some more specialized, it depends mostly on skill. Some elements are more powerful than others, not statistically, but in usage and opportunities to cast with most effect."},{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","item_id":"339280","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted April 11, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"I don't know what all the negative reviewers are blabbing about, I think this game is really unique, as a player of HoN (Only a few days...), DoTA (Maybe only a few months?), LoL (Quite some time), I think Strife is as easy as LoL, not easier.There's also a lot of things in common with DoTA 2 and LoL, they introduce the same things, with a combination of different methods (Baron, Roshan, Cindara), but Strife adds odd things like out of combat regeneration, which I actually think is perfectly fine, all the actual problems lie in normal regeneration.This game has a LOT of potential if balanced right.The meta is a bit undeveloped, due to how supports can do around as much damage as the nukers, and mages can build enough tank items to work like one, but it IS unique in the fact that top and middle are duo lanes, while bottom is usually soloed.The biggest complaint I have, however, is Ray, Strife's Teemo."},{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","item_id":"314130","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted January 31, 2015.","recommend":false,"review":"i decided to buy it as it had items I wanted, by I think buying them individually is actually cheaper, if someone can calculate the price and put it in the comments section, I'd be happy.Or angry."}]},{"0":"2xDelorean","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/2xDelorean","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"570","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted September 13, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Played for a bit...enjoyed it.

Plus you can take fall damage from sliding down slops so watch out- Loot Crates do spawn all around the map, and there's certain areas where good loot spawns.Loot mostly contains:WeaponsClothesAmmoHealthFinal:As i said the game is still in early access so not everything is in the game, but it still is a great game to playJust don't ♥♥♥♥ off a T-Rex, okay?

The game tries to make you feel good with this system of constant rewards and progression although it fails because you don't actually feel accomplished.-: No storyline, NONE.-: This game is repetitive, most of your objectives in this game are basically 'kill this and receive this' or... 'mine this and receive this'.  Due to there being no storyline you find yourself asking 'why am I even doing this?!'.-: No actual quests, you have a pre-determined set of quests that every player in the entire game is also doing.

It gives you little to no information and rather instead leaves you to sort of generate your own theories about it. This isn't a bad thing at all especially for people like me with ADHD. We easily get lost trying to keep up with stories and often forget important details. If you're looking for a story rich game  stop reading now and go look for something else  because you will be very disappointed. You will need some sort of controller if you wish to stand a chance in Titan Souls. The keyboard controls are pretty bad. GENERAL OVERVIEWTitan Souls is extremely simplistic and follows a pattern that you'll most likely come to love. Every boss is a 1-2 shot kill and you (the player) are also a one shot kill. Unlike many games where you the player may feel you have a huge advantage over the boss or vice versa I feel there's something special about Titan Souls. It may be weird to say but in Titan Souls I always felt I was on an even playing field since there is no progression (you never get any upgrades, throughout the entire game you have the same weapons, stats, etc) I actually came to love this. No BS, Titan Souls is all about skipping the grinding and getting straight to the chase; the bosses. COMBATCombat in TS takes a very interesting approach. You get one arrow which can be brought back to you by holding down the same button you used to fire the arrow. Your arrow will travel distance based on how long you charge it. This gives every shot meaning since whatever you fire you must either chase after or pull back towards you. The con of pulling is it you must stand still, this sounds like a very small thing but in TS this can make some very tricky situations during fights. Most fights come down to a matter of how well you can aim in fast paced situations.PRICE AND PLAY TIMEThe base game took me about three hours to complete. Upon beating the game you unlock a few other modes which can extend your play time but it's still the same game. I purchased this game during the Steam 2016 Summer Sale for about $3.75 and I can say it was definitely worth the price. I would definitely not puchase this game at full price though, I personally think AT MOST this game should be sold for around $10. I highly recommend you download the demo for this game as it gives you a few of the bosses from the game to see how you'll like it. This is the reason I bought TS and I can say the demo was in fact a pretty accurate representation of what the game itself is like."},{"funny":"","helpful":"6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","item_id":"397570","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted March 25.","recommend":true,"review":"If I had to describe Shmadow in a few words I'd have to say it's as if bullet hells, endless runners, and sidescrollers had a child. There isn't very much to say about this game but let's talk about it anyway. You're a ball of light who shoots other balls of various colors. Your character and your bullets produce light allowing you to see through the darkness. The more damage you take the less light you produce making it harder to survive. You get get an attack that recharges over a short cooldown and you pickup powerups which can also be used to assist you. You fight bosses and your objective is to make it as far as you can without losing. That's pretty much all there is to say about Shmadow.The GoodOne of the easiest achievement hunts you'll ever see.You can play through the entire game and refund it if you don't enjoy it due to the game being so short.You don't need a controller to do well (I got every achievement using keyboard and mouse).Due to trading cards existing you'll make a large portion of what you spent on the game (if you bought it on sale) back from selling them.Very short soundtrack although it's a very fitting song that doesn't get annoying.Regardless of how much playtime you get it's still only 2 USD.Several difficulties/modes.Really cool bosses.The BadSuper short playtime (15 ish minutes if you're playing normally and 30-90 minutes if you're achievement hunting depending on how good you are at Shmadow). One playthrough of the game is enough for a player to see every boss along with the majority of the content.I like the graphics although I cannot deny that there was very little effort put into them.There's no tutorial although there's a controls section on the main menu.You have to use the powerup to know what it does (they have no titles, just icons) and for a game this short I doubt you want to memorize all of them.If you're poor (and I mean very poor) this game isn't a good choice for you considering the lack of playtime you'll get out of it. If you aren't poor you've got nothing to lose no matter how much playtime you get out of it."},{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"550","last_edited":"Last edited July 7.","posted":"Posted December 30, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"Fun Valve classic that challenges your team work skills.

I love the super powers.. but here’s a few things to note.-\tBy completing side quests I’ve already unlocked unlimited super sprint stamina and I’m only on what.. the sixth mission?

I was later led to disappointment as I realized just how little story there actually is and that the game relies on using cliffhangers to keep the player going. I was fine with this until I completed the game and was left quite unsatisfied. The game made me very eager to see just what would happen next as I swung from stage to stage hoping that I'd get some dialogue. The ending left me quite disappointed as I saw the developer could've done much more with the game. A lot of players have trouble with this game (refer to the other reviews for this, mostly the negative). I find that this is what gives players their play time. The developer is asking $13 for a game that could take a player 1-3 hours to complete (depending on just how much they die).-----------------------------------------------------Pro/Con VersionPros- What little dialogue there is can drive your curiosuity enough to keep you playing.- Amazing atmosphere.- Fun gameplay.Cons- Very little dialogue.- 1-3 hours of gameplay.- Monotone narrator/unconvincing voice actors (don't let the narrator's beautiful voice fool you!)- Massive price tag for how long the game is.-----------------------------------------------------Conclusion: I'd say get it on sale, it's a very fun game however its price tag is just quite demanding.

There is a downside though that really hurts the community in AustraliaNo AUS servers. They may be coming soon but at the moment, I go on it regularly just to see if its had an update for AUS servers. I would still recommend picking it up if its on sale (Atleast 25%) and play with friends on a local hosted server.I give it a thumbs up, but if you're in Australia, don't bother unless you are a singeplayer person, stand high ping or if its atleast 50% off.~Hope this helped"},{"funny":"2 people found this review funny","helpful":"7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","item_id":"265750","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted January 28, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"This game..

Da game also has a wack g-thang of recyclin mob AI wit reskins, though dis be averted by adjustin certain parametas n' givin dem unique abilitizzles ta hide tha fact.

Been a Wolfenstein fan from childhood.Machine Games has managed to mix modern shooter features with the old for a very convincing experience. Solid story line and character development, Wolfenstein NO brings the FPS genre backs to its roots with fast pace action based around combat intensity, excitement and less hyper realism that has overtaken the entire genre as of late. No more ducking for cover every five seconds to regenerate your health. Wolfenstein NO makes good use of HP and Armour pick ups that allows the player to feel more apart of the story rather than just a bystander.I can't rave enough about the gun play in this game, amazing gun selection and design, almost every weapon can be dual-wielded. A good variety of weapons that all have different uses which help foster and encourage different play styles eg. stealth or open combat. This game has put to rest the argument that every FPS must embrace a multiplayer feature. While I hope due to the success of Wolfenstein NO a standalone multiplayer is developed in the future that echos the Enemy Territory model of earlier Wolfenstein games, this game easily stands tall on its singleplayer features alone.With multiple difficulties, different characters and a meaningful collectibles feature that unlocks four very unique gameplay modes, this game has plenty of replay-ability and could easily be enjoyed for many playthroughs. I don't normally like DLC but I really hope this game gets some side mission or extended story line DLC and fingers crossed a sequel in the coming year or two.Hats off to Machine Games for crafting an enjoyable singleplayer FPS in an era where everyone is obsessed with multiplayer and for standing by their development goals till completion to produce a solid product. Props also to Bethesda for backing a  studio with great talent and vision.

Fortunately I discovered most people in heroes and generals aren't very good and despite the unfair advantages they have over me, I still manage to score reasonably well sometimes.I have only played as an infantry and am rank 5 or so, so dont take this review too seriously.The vehicles are solid and it's good fun to jump on a machine gun while your mate is driving a jeep into a control point.

Buildings get low texture quality and when inside one I cannot see the walls nor floor.Once they fix the bugs- truly a worthwhile experience."}]},{"0":"76561198096766604","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198096766604","2":[{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"301520","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted July 16.","recommend":false,"review":"This game was really good before they change the layout and how it looks, now it just looks like ♥♥♥♥, when I go into a game I cant hear anything beside some ♥♥♥♥♥ talking and then they had to ♥♥♥♥ it up"}]},{"0":"76561197995322437","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995322437","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"264710","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted July 23, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"be your own jacques cousteau !dive the reef... fun little game"}]},{"0":"imsojipper","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imsojipper","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"218620","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted July 7, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"Payday 2 is one of those games where you can muck around as much as you want or play as seriously as you want its all to personal preference. Payday is a first-person bank robbing ,meth cooking, painting stealing simulator and its extremely adictive.  With many different hiest to choose from, bank robbing to cocaine dealing you can aproach each mission in any way you like from equiping the heaviest armor and the strongest gun and going loud to rob a bank to going slow and steady in stealth which does come with a experience bonus. The game is very costumisable from choosing your armor, gun, mask all the way down to your melee. But out of the the costumising you will ever do is your mask whcich defines who you are with over 100 mask to choose from and over 100 different colours and patterns no one ever has the same mask.But all up its a very enjoyable game stealth, loud, with or without friends it dosen't matter the circumstances its a great game for those who enjoy co-op strategic shooter i recomend it to all for only 30 dollars its a great pick up. Yes i know i only have 6 hours on the game when i wrote this review but when the game first came out i played the hell out of it in XBOX 360"}]},{"0":"76561198084542731","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198084542731","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"206420","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted January 16, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"ผมเล่นไม่ได้ช่วยหน่อยครับ"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"47790","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted February 16, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"เป็นเกมที่สมจริงที่สุดเท่าทีเคยเล่นมา และเป็นเกมส์ที่ให้ข้อคิดเป็นดีที่สุด และให้เห็นความลำบาก ของทหาร อมเริกา ในแต่ละหน่อย ของ แต่ละกอง ทัพ ที่พวกเขา ได้ ฝ่าฝัน อุปสรรค ต่าง ๆ มากมาย ซึ้งเกมนี้จะให้ ขอคิด ในด่านท้ายๆ  ที่จะให้ผู้เล่น ได้ยิง กับ ผู้ก่อการร้าย ซึ่งทำให้ คุณภาพ ของปืน ในแต่ละ ด่าน ซึ่ง จะ สุ่มออก ไป และ อัพเกรดได้(มั้ง) แต่ มี อีกจุดนึงที่ ผม ชอบเป็นที่สุด มันจะมีด่านนึงที่ให้เราไปช่วยเพื่อนของ อีกหน่อย ซึ่งในด่านสุดท้าย จะเปลี่ยนไปอีกแนวนึง ๆ ได้ด้วย การใช้ RPG บุกเข้าไปในด่านนั้น ๆ ซึ่งจะมีอาวุธของทหาร อเมิรกา ในด่านๆ นั้น เอง ซึ่งด่านๆ นึง ต้องใช้ความแม่น ในอีกระดับนึกของผู้เล่น ทั้งฝ่าย และใช้ ความแม่นย่ำ ต่าง ๆ ใน แต่ละ ปืน จะแตกต่างกัน ออกไป ซึ่ง แบ่ง เป็น หน่วยๆ เช่น หน่วยซุ่มยิงก็จะมีสไนเปอร์เป็นปืนหลัก หน่วย ทหาร ลาดตะเวน ก็จะมี ปืน MP7 เป็นปืนหลัก และหน่อย ทหาร ราบ ก็จะใช้ อาวุธหนัก ไปตามๆ หน่วย ในเรื่องของภาพ ก็สวยไปอีกแบบนึง แต่ก็จะมี บัคเล็กน้อย ในด่าน เกือบท้าย ๆ และขอจบ ในการ ริวิว แค่นี้ สนับสนุนให้เล่นเกมส์แท้  ขอบคุณครัชชช :3 ."}]},{"0":"76561198103671881","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198103671881","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"570","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted April 11, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Good teamwork game but most of the time there will ALWAYS be someone that will not listen or cooperate with team thus leading team to losing the game.

The rain is falling, the lightning is flashing, but it’s all silent. Also, some already existing (but horrible) SFX has been completely dropped out instead of being replaced with better ones. Monsters and skeletons on the first level make no sound at all while walking. You can hear your footsteps but monsters walk silently which looks/\"sounds\" really odd.- Keyboard controls are finally fixed, but now the gamepad is not working. Since the keys can’t be reassigned, and the default layout is terrible, the game is (at least for me) unplayable. No gamepad also means sitting in front of my monitor instead on my couch and playing on big screen TV.When at least the gamepad support is fixed I’ll gladly change my review to positive. The game progressed a lot since the original release and is finally (almost) how it should have been from the start. ----Original review:This review is based on the latest version of the game available to me, which is v1.0 for OSX (and I believe it’s also the latest version for Linux). Since the release the developers released a number of patches, Windows only. For a Windows review read somewhere else. I’ll update this as / if game gets updated.From the developers website: \"Slain! is affectionately inspired by games such as Ghosts and Goblins, Altered Beast, Shadow Of The Beast and Golden Axe\"Played all of those as a kid. The only thing that's better in Slain! are graphics. Everything else is much, much worse. So sad I backed this on Kickstarter, can't get the refund. If there was only a bug here or there, I would have hope that it can be fixed. But it's not about the bugs here (actually haven't encountered any), it's about poor game design, really bad controls, missing sound effects… In the games mentioned above there was at least some feedback / knock back when you get hit by an enemy, in Slain! enemies walk through you. Sure, all this can be fixed but it’s not a question of days but rather months. At this stage, I would suggest to the developers to slap the “early access” badge on this and take it from there.EDIT #4:As of 31 May developers \"hope\" they'll have OSX (that probably means Linux too) update ”in the near future\". Thanks for the kick in the balls, again. EDIT #3:Hoooraaay! Patch 1 is out! It fixes sooo many things! Oh, wait... it's just for Win. No patch for OSX and Linux. But the store page says the game supports OSX and Linux? Well, it also says there are trading cards and achievements.... but you know, who cares anymore.EDIT #2:Achievements are broken. You can get the first one, but that's it, the rest of them don't work. Store page states \"trading cards\", but they are nonexistent.EDIT #1:Try turning the music off and you’ll find that this game is almost mute!Except from generic footsteps and sword sounds there are no sounds when you pick up power ups, die from spikes, break stones or fall down. On the menu screen you see the rain falling and flashes on the screen (lightning) but can’t hear any of that, it’s all quiet. At the beginning a monster spawns from the ground, blood sprays from the pit, visually very dramatic… no sound… no ground rumbling, no sound of blood spraying, the monster is mute. Fire gargoyles spit fireballs from their mouths… no sound at all.  Monsters make engine revving like sound which starts quietly, then gradually goes louder, then ends abruptly and then starts over in a loop. Skeletons make a fireplace crackling like sound (bones?) but die without making any sound… The list goes on and on. And I’ll remind you all that one of the Kickstarter stretch goals (which WAS reached) was hiring “dedicated professional audio designer”."},{"funny":"2 people found this review funny","helpful":"3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","item_id":"91310","last_edited":"Last edited May 6.","posted":"Posted May 6.","recommend":false,"review":"This game is so boring & repetitive, that it hurts.

The orange sunset really pop's out and make everything this amazing orange colour (they make good wallpapers).Now, it terms of gameplay, there isn't much.

The story itself follows a character that you create that is a member of one of the three main factions (Federation, Kilingon Empire and Romulan Republic) this gives you access to a large number of humanoid races and the abilty to an extent create your own race. The missions themselves are refreshing and divided into multiple story arcs to make it easier to find a specific mission you may want to repeat.Combat is done in a great way, both space and ground combat is simple yet fun, all three playable classes (Tactical, Engineer, Science) all have defined roles that are easy to understand and easier to play as.Overall STO is a great experience that is in no way P2W, you don't need top tier ships that cost real money to peform well, sure they help but you don't need them. Tier 4 and 5 ships can still be competitive once you hit lvl 50-60 and begin the endgame content."},{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","item_id":"212680","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted October 2, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"A great game that takes permadeath to a new level but making so much fun, graphics have a nice retro feel that gives the game a great sense of imerrsion along with its great soundtrack.Recentally the free expansion Advanced Edition arrived and gave the players more ships and new mechanics to play with making an already great game even better!To sum it up FTL: Faster Than Light is a great experiance to play and is more than worth the money it costs, i can easily recommend this game to anybody that loves games with an actual challenge and sense of achievement!"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"346110","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted September 13, 2015.","recommend":false,"review":"Don't get me wrong, ARK is a fun game and it is unique in the fact that your tools include the Dinos and other annimals, however i still can't recommend the game due to the simple fact that the Devs are currently (in my opinion) more focused on adding new features that have bugs associated with them than fixing the ones that are currently in the game. It ruins the experience if your constantly finding bugs that may be small still ruin things or make the game frustrating. Another major concern i have is that you need a pretty damn good rig in order to run this, i can usually run all my games (Steam and non-steam) at their highest settings, ARK however for whatever reason i have severe trouble to run on even its lowest settings. Now i know some of you will go \"Get a better rig\" well that doesn't solve much as it is the job of the Dev team to make the game accessible to as many people as they can, and in order to do that they need to get on top of fixing and optimising the game rather than adding more features. so no i can't reccommend the game IN ITS CURRENT STATE, however if the Dev team is able to address the many issues with this game and do something simmilar to what Space Engineers is doing right now, where the devs arehalting addition of features and are just focusing on fixing the current bugs, then i'd

This game offers very little new content, with half the assassins ending up being overshadowed side mission that don't do the characters justice.The game itself is still quite good, with most of the core mechanics remaining the same. Movements, expecially grappling and gliding are a little off, and the combat (with the City approach of 'more guys = harder) starts to show it's flaws when surrounded by 20+ enemies.Overall, this game still has a very solid core to it, and should definitely be played. Yes, it is the weakest in the series, but that is because the first two were so strong. Some of the elements of this game are nicely done, just pretend multiplayer doesn't exist though. Writing (although I personally did not like the story) is quite nicely done, and everything about this game still holds it's own.The weakest part of this game is that it is the third in a series, and it is definitely a step backwards. If this was a first up game, we would still highlight the flaws but could see the room for improvment. The sad fact is that there have been two games already that have overall been better. But I do encourage you to play this game, because it is still the same engine and gameplay as the first two - and that is still a damn good thing."},{"funny":"","helpful":"2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","item_id":"218060","last_edited":"Last edited November 25, 2013.","posted":"Posted November 25, 2013.","recommend":true,"review":"Taking every element from the preivous Runner titles, Runner2 offers an experience that flows wonderfully together. With over 100 levels, dozens of unlockables, lovely visuals and a wonderful soundtrack this game is a really delight to play.The premise is simple: get from one end of the level to the other in a free-flowing smooth run. But this game is not for the people who have slow reactions times or get frustrated easily. It is hard, and quite unforgiving. Repetition is going to happening in this game, but because of the quick reload and charming music, it's hard to feel put out.When you do get a great run going, it's fantastic. All the notes and melodies stiched together with your actions makes it a grand way to know you're doing well. Not to mention that it also helps timing your moments with the logical note progression.Over the multiple different worlds, there are retro levels, multiple paths and different bosses to change things up, and the dastardly combinations of different moments makes you really appreciate the level design - which may appear simplistic at times - but it very finely tuned.This game is great in short bursts for those that don't have much time, it's great for those wanting a challenge, and especially if you like the recognition for seamlessly stringing together your levels and actions. Everything about this game screams that the developer cared about making their game. From the cutscenes narrated by Charles Martinet (who also does the voice for Mario) right down to the charming animations and fluid movement.This game is something you should seriously consider purchasing, playing, loving and then realising that you have to do the whole game on all three difficulties and then all the extras and then costumes and then..."},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"24240","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted July 19, 2012.","recommend":true,"review":"First you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the women.By taking all of them by force with guns."}]},{"0":"76561198069170979","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198069170979","2":[{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"440","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted June 26, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Great Game While It Lasted"}]},{"0":"76561198085956238","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198085956238","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","item_id":"224540","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted February 3.","recommend":false,"review":"i have played around 2 hours of this game and they were the worst 2 hours i have ever spent gameing this just felt like a tf2 knock off"},{"funny":"","helpful":"0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","item_id":"242860","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted February 3.","recommend":false,"review":"i played this game for 40 hours and then was banned for cheating i have no idea how i was cheating i guess i was to good for the game game to handle :("},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"47410","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted February 18.","recommend":true,"review":"i have no problem spending a bit of money on a free game if it is good and yes this game is worth it and it is free so if you dont like it you have lost nothing."},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"34330","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted February 13.","recommend":false,"review":"Buys game cant even play it 10/10"}]},{"0":"76561198132540690","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198132540690","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"730","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted May 26, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"kinda gets boring overtime but ok!"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"220200","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted March 5, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Best Game Ever!!!!!!"}]},{"0":"711armageddoncarmageddon","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/711armageddoncarmageddon","2":[{"funny":"2 people found this review funny","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"113020","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted July 4, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"*Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.*"},{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"105600","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted July 3, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Maps usually end up having more signs than ♥♥♥♥ing Las Vegas."},{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"9480","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted July 3, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"I've created better roleplaying characters than half of Gmod's community has."}]},{"0":"76561198034868596","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034868596","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"359870","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted June 17.","recommend":true,"review":"Even montion blur couldn't stop me from buying this game for a 4th time and enjoying doing anything and everything involved with FFX/X-2"}]},{"0":"Andraison","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Andraison","2":[{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","item_id":"22230","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted July 31, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Hade me lost for words. 10/10 game. just buy it allready"}]},{"0":"76561198055790408","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055790408","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"203770","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted December 6, 2013.","recommend":true,"review":"one of the best in depth stratergy game i have ever played big learning curve but a tone of fun to play so.....

If you’re looking to have fun with mate or just by yourself, play, BF4, COD (Not ghost) or B2. I found that the actual shooters elements of the game is dull. Yeah, you got skyhooks and things around you, which are very handy, but the amount of enemies I had to face was annoying and at times, boring. You also can only have 2 weapons at a time. But what I did like was the power ups, which all had different uses. But for half the game I used like 2 of them, which I think they're is like over 7 or something. So why is this game so good? This game really shines, and is utterly unbeaten, with its engaging storyline. What a story, I never thought a game could engage me and make me care about the characters like this. I kept pushing on the average shooter because of this story. Also, there is a lot of freedom for the play, or as it seems. The graphics is more than good and the city is really awesome to, which you get to explore bits and pieces of the downtown dark alley ways to the wealth and good looking streets, parks, houses and more. So overall, this game is a masterpiece in its own right, and has defiantly set a new started in terms of storytelling games. (P.S. The ending will blow you away and I played most of this game on the PS3)8.5/10"}]},{"0":"76561198099625419","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198099625419","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"230410","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted May 8, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"Mt loko"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"200260","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted May 8, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"Um jogo muito loko e com uma história ♥♥♥♥"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"19900","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted December 22, 2013.","recommend":true,"review":"Bem legal !!!"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"241540","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted December 20, 2013.","recommend":true,"review":"Jogo bem planejago um jogo muito bom"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"220","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted November 28, 2013.","recommend":true,"review":"Mt bom da um pouco de adrenalina na maioria das partes  mt bom mesmo !!"}]},{"0":"76561198084032274","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198084032274","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"227940","last_edited":"Last edited November 23, 2014.","posted":"Posted October 29, 2014.","recommend":false,"review":"Good but still needs work.Also the fighter pilot controls are strange and odd to control its not that fun to play as the pilot because of this.And match making is stupid for tanks.Also i want to play as a tank with my friend who is infantry how do i do this?why would early ww2 tanks vs late ww2 tanks it really stupid make somekind of tier system or something.

There is an amazing amount of polish and balance, from the visuals and the strategic depth, all the way to the raw and dirty visceral depths that combat can descend to.Let me tell you about the combat; It is good. My most memerable battle so far was a 2v2 where I aided a weaker captain vs a bandit, only for a high level bandit to join in.Bandit capital ships are weaker but they have an insane number and reserve of strike craft, which increases by level (not fighters, those are different). My ally engaged the motherships while I thinned the swarm but he was being overwhelmed, so I rammed the strongest enemy and kept thrusting to push him away (ramming is a big mechanic, more on it later). Freed to 1v1, my ally succeeded in destroying the first pirate, but at high cost; his shields down, his nose and two wing modules torn off and floating free, a core destroyed and his health but a sliver. Sensing blood, the swarm of strike craft pounced. There was nothing I could do to save him. He exploded magnificently, destroying many of his attackers who were too slow to flee.The remaining pirate and I circled while exchanging broadsides, each deadly piroette bringing us closer to a field of asteroids. His strongest weapons were on his nose and he fought to bring them to bear. I, meanwhile, was slightly more manoeuverable and clung on the the relative safety of his rear, while picking of the remaining swarm. Our shields failed at the same time.Shields, armour and hull are not just 3 interchangeable stats in SPAZ2. Shields are the most familiar, a flat, regenerating, protective field. Armour is different. Every single non core piece of the motherships have their own armour, some of which is shared to the core. If a part loses all its armour, it is torn off, and sometimes destroyed. Hull, or health is only relevent to the cores of the ship and when that is gone; boom. So unlike other games, it isn't destroy shields>armour>hull with various piercing weapons, it is shields>tear them to pieces or shoot straight for the core.We tore each other to pieces. I took his right wings out but clipped an asteroid at speed, destroying my left. Caught against it, he was able to bring his nose to bear, shreading off my remaining wings and one of my engines. Now he was more manoeuverable.In despairation, I boosted, smaller asteroids tearing into my hull until I placed a large one between us. Frustrated momentarily, he stopped and reloaded. Seizing this last opportunity, I came out of hiding behind him, my last weapons pounding his engine, trying to even the score. But it wasn't enough. He began to turn and rained fire on my last engine. Before I could be left helpless, I once more boosted, this time straight at his exposed engine, knocking it into the void while my nose crumpled and exploded.Both helpless now, no engines, but still he had weapons and he slowly, ever so slowly, turned to bring that hateful nose to bear. With nothing left, I had a moment of inspiration and grabbed the astreroid chunks with my tractor beam. In space, surrounded by the refuse of awesome technology, I beat him to death with a rock.A narrow victory, I collected the refuse of our 4 ships to just bearly rebuild 1, and then jumped to the void.All actions described above REALLY ARE IN THE GAME. If two things collide, they do armour type damage (very weak vs shields, weak vs hull) to eachother based on their mass and speed. If you can get an enemies shields down while yours are still up, boost at him/her, smash their bits off! Beware of ramming with your shields down, as you can wreck yourself. Finally, you can rebuild your mothership WHILE IN COMBAT. A wing came off? Try and grab it before it goes to far, and reattach it! Enemies powerful weapon came off? Remove your own and replace it!Did I mention I love this game?Also, there are so many viable ways of building your mothership, and none are perfect for all situations. I keep parts in storage to swap forms when dealing with different kinds of threats (General flying, starbases, pirates, mining) but my general form is the ION shield ram: Huge shields/thrust and some ION weapons or lasers to take down shields so I can ram them. It is weak to strike craft and starbases however, and is hard to mine with."}]},{"0":"IKillNoobsFirst","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IKillNoobsFirst","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","item_id":"730","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted March 27, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":" Best game I have played on steam.

For a game released in 2003 it still stands pretty well today and even has a whole modding communtiy to back it up to keep the game interesting. I find this game to be really replayable as I keep coming back to play the through the game over and over again. Although it may be somewhat short, I find it just adds to the replayability of the game. The racing itself gets pretty fast paced when you get out of the first hub world with features like the burnout, nitrous and wheelies (for bikes) to keep you getting back up to speed pretty quickly. The open-world combined with open checkpoint style races allow for the player to go their own route through the races (or at least to the next checkpoint) or just follow the AI. Because of this, however, most races might require multiple tries to be able to learn the race beforehand and know where you're actually going and to take the optimal route to win. Trying to do these for the first time can sometime prove difficult as the races get longer and checkpoints are spread further out, which is where some of the difficulty comes in. Also that you have to use your current vehicle to beat people who are using vehicles of (most of the time) better performance. This isn't necessarily a complaint from me as the feeling from finally finishing first after many tries is amazing, knowing you can finally move on through the career. My only complaint is the bloody traffic; the most annoying/frustrating part about this game. I don't know if I just have really bad luck or something but it seems everytime a traffic car 'swerves' out of the way it always ends up swerving right into me as I see everyone pass me in that instant. Also when random long busses like to go across intersections right when you happen to be crossing perpendicular to them. But besides that, I absolutely love this game.*ProbablyJustANostalgiaFanaticReview*"}]},{"0":"76561198049916759","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049916759","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"219990","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted July 2, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Good game, combined best aspects of great ARPGs, d1 2 tl1 2 van helsing1, and with a few new ones of its own.

This game, is nuts! I am a GIANT clicker fan, starting with cookie clicker, to Adventure Capatalist (of what is more of an Idle game) to Clicker Heroes! But this clicker is my favourite.  Here's why.1. It has AIMING! As with all bland games, aiming makes things better! Such as my favourite MMO of all time, Wildstar.So when this clicker had aiming I knew it was worth a \"Shot\". (Yes, that was a pun).2. It was based on one of the coolest games in the VR Universe, Time Rifters. To be based in the same scenery is a lovely trip to your brains memory compartment, if you haven't seen that game, then it's just a cool place to be in general.3. Its got great progression! Not at one point did I feel It was going too fast or too slow, and when I needed money the most, a Rainbow Money Ball would come along and help me out!So in total this is the greatest Clicker/Idle/Shooter of all time!

The story isn't half bad, the level design is fabulous and the graphics is eye candy. There are afew flaws, some times words entered aren't adapted and it won't help you spell your workshop creations (I happen to have made afew) so it can be a little tedious when trying to make somthing specific.

Software which only works on a Samsung monitor (thanks for the brown paper envelope, guys).It sucks, and is of no benefit to the consumer. The PC platform's strength is broad compatibility regardless of who manufactures the components or peripherals. This is the thin end of the wedge, and PC gamers should stand together in giving a well deserved collective middle finger to anyone involved in these shabby practices.Oh, and as far as the review goes, I couldn't play the game in VR because Codemasters were bribed into avoiding the de facto OpenVR standard in favour of locking down the hardware with Oculus' proprietory drivers, so....That's a huge thumbs down and a generous 2 testicles/10 rating for this one.

You can also  lvl up  geometry skill which will allow you to mine higher lvl rocks and get more resorces from them, as far as pvp goes i have yet to try it out. I find that melee is a good skill to start lvling up right away because it can become handy later on, also the quest system is nice filled with different varieties and you never feel as if you have done the same quest more that twice.The map is HUGE and would take hours to explore and going out past a certain point you will find that enemies will get tougher very quickly which will force you to lvl up before exploring more which is good because when you die from a hard enemy and then go lvl up a little bit when you go back to that same enemy you feel like you are getting stronger and making progress towards you'r character.

Well I'm in it so it's guaranteed to be epic. All jokes aside though the game is awesome, and you can read my review to know more.The game overall is awesome, it's like borderlands 2, but it's better. The Scaling in BL2, was horrible from level 50 upwards. You need OP and Gamebreaking gear to get anywhere in the game fomr UVHM onwards. And I can already see the scaling in this game is a lot better. I'm able to now use Purple guns to defeat a raid boss, solo. The visuals, can be a little repetitive at times, but overall they are appealing and does bring different environments into the game. Now as for gameplay, well, many, including me who had seen the gameplay, thought that the butt-stomp ability would be a gimmick in the game that I would never use. I was wrong. It adds so much more to the combat, in addition with the low gravity, killing is a lot more fluid, getting around on foot isn't so boresome, and depending on how you use your \"double jump\", and where you activate the extra boost, gives completely different outcomes. For example, if I need to get to a higher ledge, a jump and boost when i'm halfway until the fulcrum of my jump, giving me a way higher jump. But If I was to say get passed a very wide crevice I would start sprinting, jump then activate the boost before I start descending. And this all may seem simple, but it can be applied to the combat maneuvres and it overall makes combat more pleasing. I particularly like to use the second descripted type of jump a lot when traversing without a vehicle, it practically triples my movement time and comes in handy, even in the normal gravity environments, such as Helios.Now for Classes. Of course everyone started the game as claptrap, so i'm going to go and do something different like I usually do, I played the game as Nisha, speccing into her middle and right trees, and found myself being basically a god, maybe here is where the teamwork really comes into play. Having all 4 Nisha's running around wouldn't work, because you have no way of healing or buffing teammates. Nisha is a very combat centred solo class. And I would say she is needed for every kind of boss fight, she deals damage and deals it where it matters. Claptrap, is a must have, he gives the team random buffs, and helps out alot with co-op, lots of health boosts, dmg boosts etc. Athena plays the role of the tank healer, she is a great class to play as with friends, although solo not so much. Her abilities are a lot like Maya's except she soaks up damage. She is also a vital part to the team, giving out lots of Health regen. I didn't play wilhelm much, but from what I did, He is just a straight up tank class. He takes all of the damage dealt while dealing a fair enough amount of damage. He is the most Balanced class from what i've played of him but isn't very fun (for lack of better term), So overall the classes have their own Pros and cons and they all do their own special thing that makes them vital to the team.As an overall, I'd say the game does use lots of content from Borderlands 2, including some legendaries and renamed Unique guns. The humour is a step up from Borderlands 2 and as an Australian I did get all of the jokes, so that could be a downside for some players who don't know much of Australian slang and colloquialism. But yes, the humour is well done and implemented, the story is EXCELLENT. I love it. *No spoilers* I hate lilith for what she did to jack, and I empathised for Jack as the hours passed. Some of the negative reviews here state that the campaign didn't give enough XP to get to the required levels, but that's because they didn't do the side missions, which were frankly better this time around. There is a lot more variety and SO MUCH story to be told in the side missions, like how Terramorphous made it onto Pandora, when Threshers where only a Moon Species (DAMN YOU HAMMERLOCK), or how Jack comes up with the idea of Moonshotting loaders to Pandora etc. Lots of things storywise are excellent, with a nice twist on Jack at the end and how he gets the scar on his face. The story just blew my mind the first time around, and I stuck around long enough for 3 more playthroughs up to TVHM and still find it enjoyable. I especially can't wait for the UVHM pack that will have a new Narrative Voice over along with Tiny Tina. Overall Game was excellent.Now for a short list of Pros and Cons incase you don't want to read all that garbage.Pros:- Story- Classes- Visuals- Soundtrack- Gameplay- Combat- Low Gravity- Enemy Scaling- Weapon Scaling- Replayability (I'd die if I didn't put that in there)Cons:- Nisha and Claptrap are the only 2 classes that are really enjoyable in SP and MP- Wilhelm and Athena lack enough SP Skills to play SP, but are both great for MP- Not as many legendaries- Maybe too many reused Borderlands 2 Assets- Comedy can get a little dry after a whileAnyway that's my Review of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel I give this game an overall of:8.7/10. It's more of the same which isn't bad, it still has that Borderlands Charm, it delivers where in lots of ways Borderlands 2 failed. And even though it seems mediocre amongst many giants coming out this year, it's defenitely my Game of the Year. I can't wait for the Doppelganger Pack release tomorrow, and like i've said many many times. This game overall is excellents. It's a must buy for borderlands fans, and a must buy if you want to try out the series. TL;DR Game overall is excellent, more of the same Borderlands you love while changing it up a bit. New players will love it, while old fans will cherish it."}]},{"0":"TeH-B-Rad","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeH-B-Rad","2":[{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","item_id":"730","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted September 22, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)﻿"},{"funny":"2 people found this review funny","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"440","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted April 9, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Best hat simulator on the market.14/10 would waste my time again."}]},{"0":"BAW_Killer","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BAW_Killer","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"221100","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted May 25, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"Play COD noobs, \"All your beanz belong to us.\""},{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","item_id":"287700","last_edited":"Last edited December 14, 2015.","posted":"Posted December 13, 2015.","recommend":false,"review":"I have to down vote this game.

Thus, Rust had nothing more to offer for me and I completely stopped playing it.- EARLY EARLY ACCESS REVIEW -Rust well.. It's different.It may be in Alpha but it's already such a great game, I'm excited and dreading new updates, I love the way it is at the moment, not knowing if the upcoming developments will ruin what i think or make it even better, going to have to wait and find out, I spend most of my time playing this game, Surely enough playing on a populated server isn't a good idea, it'll ruin your experience all together, the key is to find a decent server with only about 20-40 people online, i'd say start off with a pve until you get the hang of things. Also playing on Official servers aren't exactly the best idea.Wolves and bears have a fair amount of health compared to the zombies, bears and wolves you have to avoid until you have a bow or a gun, zombies you can take on with a pickaxe etc. This is a great game and definitely worth the money, considering it's in Alpha, it's damn well good.I thought it'd be one of those games that look great but turn out pretty bad, Looks great, is great.The only downer for me is the fact it over heats my laptop, and that's when I play with Render Quality 0, and run it on the fastest option. The graphics are great.. but I can't really play with them. I have a decent gaming laptop.. but still It overheats so I have to take breaks and I don't like that.All in all, Great game, definitely worth a look at :)I'm sure more people would buy it if there was a demo, then again it's in alpha and only $20, Still worth a look :)I surely don't regret this game and I won't anytime soon =D"},{"funny":"","helpful":"3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","item_id":"203160","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted December 1, 2013.","recommend":true,"review":"Tomb Raider is amazing, It's my favourite game by far.

But unfortunately it has it's downsides. I think i'll start with positive stuff, which is lot's.- The Graphics are amazing, but require a very good computer to actually get them.- Many of the sounds in the game are beautifully made and recorded, some of the best sound in any plane/tank simulator game.- Driving mechanics can be quite clunky, but are amazing when you get used to them.- Tank battles (arcade) can be pretty fun, especially lower tiers. Once you get higher though, it starts.....the bias.....the grinding......the broken game mechanics :(- Planes are great, but same as tanks, fun at low tier, not as much at higher tiers.Okay, now.....it's time for the brutal stuff._ *One day, Birdman Kreb's was driving his T-34 1942* While i was driving, i spotted a few enemy tanks and quickly dispatched them (surprisingly). I continued driving and ran into a Panzer IV, i also dispatched that (again surprising). Then i made the mistake and drove out of cover, and ran into a M4 Sherman. Now this is where the bull#### began. He fired on me and killed my entire crew 0_0. Now i would have been fine, if i didn't watch the replay. What i saw was, the bullet hitting my side armour (fired from the front) and hit the surface at an angle that would have made my armour more than 200mm (yes i tested this) and this somehow, bounced into my tank and killed everyone.(And if i ever get a pic of this, i'll put it up.)And yes i know about Russian bias and yes i hate it. Being in a kv-1 and taking 20+ hits from M4 Jumbo's and Stug's and a Pz IV, just seemed a bit crazy.Overall though, good game. Worth downloading (if you ahve a good computer).Just watch out for Russian Tanks, always aim for the turrets.Okay so i just out of a game, and i had my usual, T-50, T-34, Zis-30 and Kv-1. Only to be destroyed by an Su-122, that thing has a battle rating 1.3 higher than any of those tanks and is a tier higher, what is this matchmaking. >:("},{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","item_id":"34330","last_edited":"Last edited May 25.","posted":"Posted May 25.","recommend":true,"review":"I don't even know where to start with this.......All i can say is, i didn't know what to expect from this game.So let me start with all the good stuff:D-So we have some kinda smarter AI, even at times when they aren't smart its amusing to see them flail and fall on it's face.-The campaigns are pretty damn cool, this has to be one of the first TW games i've actually enjoyed playing camp.-THE GRAPHICS, HOLY HELL. Now my computers pretty terrible, so i'm surprised i can even get it to high graphics.-The voice acting, well what do i say other than, SHAMEFRU DISPRAY!-So glad to see AI soldiers actually attempting to fire over hills and such.

Each class on each team has access to different guns, attachments etc. And you have a set amount of equipment tokens/points to spend on your loadout. You also have a weight meter which can determine whether your loadout will make you run fast or slow, and how fast your stamina will run out.Now lets get into the combat:The combat is fast paced at times and slow paced at others, you will constantly find yourself having to visually inspect whether you have killed a person and wondering \"should i check or should i run past and hope the enemy is dead\". From the last sentence you probably can tell the game is going to be realistic. It is. If you move up on your own your playing a wild card, instead you might want to call out a couple of your teammates to help you complete/capture an objective (Yes, there are a lot of different gamemodes to choose from, most of which include control areas). There is virtually no HUD (Heads Up Display), the only things that do show up on the hud is how many magazines you have, and info about the objective(s). The gunplay is realistic, recoil is a thing and attachments can supress that recoil but also you can by swithing modes on your gun or burst firing. 1-2 bullets from most guns can take down an enemy.Lets talk graphics:The graphics in the game are not spectactular, but still enough to immerse you in the gameplay, though the design and textures on the weapons look great. You can't really expect a game run and made on the source engine  and is only slightly modified is going to get you amazing Battlefield graphics.Overall Gameplay:The gameplay is realistic, tense and rewarding if you play the game right, what a mordern military shooter should be, it offers great and realistic gunplay, a variety of gamemodes and maps. Insurgency will keep you coming back to play some more (also teamwork is a thing in this game)."},{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"252950","last_edited":"Last edited March 17.","posted":"Posted December 25, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Great banter has been had while playing this game. 10/10 would play again.BTW ONLY PLAY WITH CONTROLLLER PC CONTROLS ARE ♥♥♥♥"},{"funny":"2 people found this review funny","helpful":"1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","item_id":"318420","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted May 4.","recommend":true,"review":"The gameplays relatively the same as the main game but with more focus on branding uruks rather than killing them, but the main attraction is the One Ring which to be fair is OP againts warcheifs and makes them a breeze but i guess thats what the One Ring is, a ring of power.

Around the launch of DS3 i would spend hours watching PvP, reviews and lore videos while i was saving for the game. One faithful day i stumbled across a review that changed my entire perspective on it, something so terrible i could not bare to spend a single dollar on that embarrasment that is DS3. The review simply stated some broken and missing mechanics that of which are alive and well in DS2. What are these key mechanics you may ask? To put it simply in a complete and utter overlook on fromsofts behalf, they managed to leave out the single thing that made DS2 so superior, so excellent. That mechanic my friend is Common Fruit.9/10 Hopefully FromSoft redeems themselves by readding Common Fruit in their new DLC and then maybe i will purchase DS3."},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"218620","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted August 22, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"THE THERMAL DRILL, GO GET IT!"}]},{"0":"76561198073642113","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073642113","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"550","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted October 21, 2012.","recommend":true,"review":"this game is fckn EPIC!!!"},{"funny":"","helpful":"0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","item_id":"218620","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted January 6, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"Beautiful"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"55140","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted December 17, 2013.","recommend":true,"review":"Beautiful"}]},{"0":"76561198211433640","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198211433640","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"218620","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted January 3.","recommend":true,"review":"игра норм "},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"730","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted November 13, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"саветую играть всем лицам игра норм играйте все то без читов"}]},{"0":"ilyjoepoe","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ilyjoepoe","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"318430","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted March 10, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Bought for 14 cents, trading cards were 15 cents altogether.

One of which has a password, the second is barely ever available and the third is a blast to play on. When its not full. Because when it is full you have nothing to do but bare with the >200 ping. However there are plenty of EU and US servers on there.If your still unsure, just look at some peoples playtimes :P while you definetly wont be able to get 1000 hours out of it since it isnt as active as it was, for $10 USD its definetely going to be worth the money if you can bare the extremely steep learning curve.

They took an odd concept and executed it wonderfully for such an early game. There's a lot to do and different risks such as not having enough food, slimes escaping at the early net stage and those evil tarr slimes. There is also great reward, smiling slimes, a feeling of completing objectives you've set for yourself and just all in all happy times. Can't wait to see what else they add to the game. New slimes?

The game is perma death, meaning when you die your run is over for good, adding a bunch of challenge to the game. Gungeon has a dodge roll mechanic that is used to avoid bullets, and consumable blanks that destroy all bullets on the screen. These make the game a bit easier.There are many many different guns, buffs and active and passive abilites, allowing for heaps of potential synergies.

The stealth is way to easy aswell like orcs are just way too stupid and the attract button makes the game way to easy.  The nemesis system is good either having like your own army withing the system or let the orcs fight themselves within the system and see how they progress within the army.

Story (6/10):  While nothing special it does have its set of memorable characters. The main cast is pretty average and forgettable but the characters in the side quests are hilariously whacky and memorable. Graphics (8/10):  The game is absolutely beautiful and has flawless triple monitor support. You can see ripples on the clothing, grass and trees moving in the wind which only gets better during raining and storming weather. The facial animations on non story critical characters are a little stiff but the animations are pretty good otherwise.  Gameplay (8/10):  The gameplay is pretty good and the parkour is pretty smooth, it may be no mirrors edge but it still boasts a lot of similar parkour. The melee combat is where the game shines with upgradable melee weapons that degrade over time, you can get perks to help make your weapons last longer but even at higher level youre still watching your melee weapon usage. The gun play is pretty good and im disappointed the guns dont wear down Far Cry 2 style but it balances out since melee weapons do more damage.The night time can be absolutely terrifying right up until higher levels, my first experience with night time was an adrenaline rush even in coop.The game will feel very familiar to those who've played Mirror's Edge and as a fan of Mirror's Edge, i can easily recommend this game for those looking for a new parkour game. Controls:  I'm not giving a score on this since I played it on both PC and Xbox 360 controller controls, so I'll write a mini review for it.The PC controls are pretty good but the mouse sensivity takes time to get used to (i really cant explain this problem) but it still feels very natural compared to most multiplatform titles. The Xbox 360 controlers however, are clunky and take a lot of time getting used to but still very playable ones used to it. Coop (8/10):  The coop is pretty damn good, its peer2peer and you join the client's game and you do their quests and story. Its drop in and drop out so you can leave and join anytime. The \"Be The Zombie\" gamemode is similar to the Dark Souls invasion and can make even the most battle hardened survivors work together. I really recommend this game if youre tired of all the current coop zombie games like CoD zombies, Left 4 Dead 2 and Killing Floor. Technical Info:  This game isnt quite optimized for PC and my first 5-10 hours involved me having a problem where the cutscenes would run at 15fps despite pulling 40fps in triple screen resolution (5760x1080) and apparently its coming problem but looks like its fixed now (it happened to different people no matter the resolution or setup).The game has flawless triple monitor support and the side screens darken when entering cinematics. I recommend keeping \"View Distance\" at the default or turning it down because it has a major performance impact for little effect (it just makes foliage more visible in the distance, thats it).Apparently this game has very very basic Oculus Rift support but I havent tested it until they get something worth testing."},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"346010","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted February 18, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"This game is addicting as hell.

I got this dlc as a part of my season pass, so I didn't pay the $9.99 price tag. But if you didn't buy a season pass and are considering buying this dlc separately, I recommend you do not.There are really only two new characters with a decent amount of interaction introduced in this dlc. One I felt was developed very well, and will keep as a companion for a while. The other, was very shallow. There was barely any character development to make me feel anything for them. They could have been a no name raider and plucked at the same heartstrings during the big choice of this dlc.The robot customisation added by this dlc is quite neat. All of it balances nicely with no obvious power play options. And it's fun to have your own custom companion. But this, ultimately, is no different to any other companion. Sure, I can give them sword arms, but I could just give another companion a sword for the same effect. The interface is also slightly confusing; it is difficult to follow what change in damage/resistance a mod will cause without doing the manual check yourself. I was beginning to trust those little +++.Coming into this dlc with a lv 50 character (playing on survival) I really only felt challenged on combat at one stage in this dlc. That's not isolated to this dlc though, I feel fallout 4 has difficulty issues regardless. But this dlc does nothing to rectify this.Oh and if you're not a junk hoarder then I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors amassing your new hoard if you want to build any decent robot mods.There are a few new weapons added in this dlc as well, with the majority being mele, then energy. These are not something a level 50+ is going to start using though. Even with full modification, they fail to pack any considerate punch.There are also some unique power armor mods added in this dlc, but they are non transferable and will only benefit energy weapons users.In the end this dlc adds some cool features to your settlement and a cool new companion, but other than that there is nothing really new that is worth the $9.99 pricetag if you're considering buying this dlc outright."},{"funny":"","helpful":"12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","item_id":"275850","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted August 17.","recommend":false,"review":"When this game was first announced at E3 all those years ago, I joined the growing communioty following it.

You play as a spelunker and a boiled down summary of the aim of the game is to get to the next level by maneuvering from the top of the level to the exit at the bottom, all the while avoiding a multitude of enemies and traps. Each playable character (and there are a variety to choose from) is equipped with a whip to kill enemies or smash pots or deflect arrows. Really it serves as a multipurpose tool.GraphicsColourful, vibrant and beautiful 2D art that complements the game perfectly. Pretty explosion effects. It is a nice looking game.ReplayabilityConceivably infinite. Every level is different as they are all randomly generated. It is highly unlikely you will ever play the same level twice and if you did you would most likely not notice as you'd be too busy whipping bats and jumping spikes and enjoying avoiding death.It took me 100 hours of co-op to beat the game with my brother and that was most fulfilling experience ever.

This game is also used for the shop which is used for the keys to unlock these crates that are usually what you might get over a nice weapon or a rare chance of a simple hat. But honestly do people really want to spend over 30 or maybe 60 but not even exactly 100 dollars on some stupid ♥♥♥ ring that no one will ever buy for unless they really wanted to spend it on that damn thing, I say no you can get anything you wanted thats not some cosmetic item for your classes to all wear but i say that these items that i have seen and the new things that have even appeared in this game are just useless, all you get are some weapons or the main thing of hats which i have seen over the time that i have played this damn game. But unlike other games i have seen or played such as CS:GO also do the same thing with the shopping mechanism of the keys and crates for weapons. But as for TF2 I would say that i wouldn't even dare to touch or play this game even if they have made some good buffs but after that gunn metel update it just made it all go away for me and started to not even play it one single bit.

Graphics, Gameplay, level design and even well designed AI make this game a hell of a good BETA. It will leave you with generally only one main complaint, and thats content.Now of course content will be lacking in an early access title, but grip has managed to create an experience where, even though there is only three maps for racing at the moment, each race will leave you with a different opinoin. This is thanks to level design, incorporating the abillity to drive up walls, take side paths (both of which are usually drasticly different) and landing good items and benefital positions.The Kaos of the race, explosions everywhere while you narrowly avoid rocks and ramps wizzing past you, while dust sprays from the back of your tires all the while trying to keep an eye out of the player infront of you, makes this game really really fun.

To top it off, loot system is extremely broken.Avoid this on PC, hackers galore. Developers have had no concrete response to tackling hackers. In fact hackers have no fear playing this and posting their hacking videos on YT. Developers enforce a 3 day ban followed by permanent ban but are being circumvented by hackers simply changing their names. Glitching has been rampant for a while now, and no actions have been taken to resolve this issue also, which means most people are OP in PvP. There are also so many bugs relating to connection, the quality of servers are intermittent at best, while several of the talents do not even work. In fact, sometimes they are the oppostite. The attitude of Ubisoft and Massive are: close threads down of anyone posting any negative feedback, while communicating the absolute minimum: the silence indicates that this game is in trouble. The fact that vendor blueprints are more exciting that loot drops is alone a sign of a completely broken game.I thought I'd be proven wrong by forking out early and getting the GOLD and Season pass, but I regret this. Apart from the extremely brief social co-op experience this game provided, the only other positive that I've gotten out of this game is to never every buy a game and season pass that Massive/Ubisoft have laid their dirty little fingers on."}]},{"0":"aerpub","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aerpub","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"265930","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted March 29, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"There is no where to start with the review of this game.

Whether due to shifting market trends or a mid-life identity crisis, the Golden Arches has decided to completely reinvent itself as an upmarket restaurant chain. It’s a bold new direction for the company with a focus on premium ingredients, dine-in perks and customer creation via “Build-A-Burger” touch screens. Yesterday, we tested the fancy new service at its maiden store in Castle Hill, NSW. The results exceeded our wildest expectations.Study the above photo. It doesn’t look like your typical Macca’s fare, does it? Remove the tell-tale cup and it could almost be a burger from a glitzy steak house or high-end pub. What you’re looking at is a bespoke burger packed with an Angus beef patty, lettuce, tomato, egg, smoked Applewood bacon, red onion rings, jalapenos, grilled mushrooms, chilli jam and no less than four types of cheeses. (Yep, I went all in and I don’t regret a thing — but more on that later.)This is what McDonald’s wants to become in Australia and it’s pulling out all the stops to make it happen. While the service is currently only available in a single Castle Hill outlet, the company is embarking on a nation-wide roll out over the next two years. Consider it the final step in McDonald’s hipster gentrification (hipsterfication?) — a process that arguably started with the Angus and M Selection range.So how does it work? If you just want to grab a quick ‘n’ dirty Big Mac, McDonald’s will still cater to you via the usual ordering process. However, there’s also a touch screen kiosk where customers can get a whole lot fancier. There are several ready-built deluxe burgers to choose from, although the emphasis is firmly on customer creation.There are more than 30 ingredients to choose from, including two types of buns, four kinds of cheese, two types of bacon and a range of specialty toppings including grilled pineapple, guacamole, beetroot, grilled mushrooms and a range of gourmet sauces. Handily, the display automatically tallies the kilojoule count of your order after you’ve added all the toppings.The touch screen interface has been built to impress: it’s large, responsive and easy to navigate with visual representations of all the available ingredients. With the possible exception of geriatric Luddites, the UI shouldn’t give customers any trouble. (Trained staff are hovering nearby just in case you have any questions.) You can also order standard menu items from the touch screen, which means you don’t have to split from your lunch partner if they just want a Quarter Pounder.Once you’ve made your selection you can pay for it instantly via an inbuilt credit card terminal. You’re then presented with a receipt and invited to sit down as your meal is freshly prepared. It will then be served to you on a dinky wooden platter. (Plastic trays are for bogans, dontcha know.)The new menu doesn’t look like fast food and it doesn’t act like it either: waiting times are significantly longer than McDonald’s customers are accustomed to. It took close to 15 minutes for my order to arrive by which point I was completely famished. Mind you, this is fairly typical for a non-fast-food burger so I won’t begrudge them too much.Just be aware that you might be in for an even lengthier wait during peak meal times. The manager I spoke to admitted that things can slow to a crawl when lots of bespoke orders come in at once. If your time is limited, our advice is to show up at least an hour before the lunch/dinner crowd.When my burger finally arrived, I was immediately impressed with the size and construction. If the ready-made options are anything like this, we may have the first perfect Takeaway Truth score on our hands. But looks can be deceiving. For as long as anyone can remember, McDonald’s has been synonymous with cheap, bland food. Would this be more of the same with a higher price tag?The answer is an emphatic no. Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the best McDonald’s burger I’ve tasted by a significant margin. It may even be my favourite fast food burger, period. The combination of familiar Macca’s meat and gourmet toppings went together wonderfully. My only reservation is that it was a bit hard to eat due to its massive size. Annoyingly, McDonald’s doesn’t include plastic cutlery with orders unless you ask.Apart from that tiny caveat, I really don’t have anything mean to say about this burger or the upscale service that spawned it. Would I pay $30 for a version with the lot? Of course not. But for $15 or so, this is a perfectly acceptable meal — attractive, delicious and so very filling.In conclusion, McDonald’s has clearly realised it needs to adapt with the times and it is moving confidently in the right direction. Fast food just got a serious upgrade. Colour us excited."}]},{"0":"76561198142474106","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198142474106","2":[{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"4000","last_edited":"Last edited December 23, 2015.","posted":"Posted December 13, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"is gud.can build heavy tank then destroy heavy tank.21?/10 would do it again"},{"funny":"","helpful":"3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","item_id":"363620","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted December 7, 2015.","recommend":false,"review":"would be yes if this game didnt cost more than whats expected..should be renamed from 'tea party simulator' to 'extra chromesome simulator'its way too hard to play."},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"397340","last_edited":"Last edited December 30, 2015.","posted":"Posted December 26, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Absolutely Great game.

Games are like pools, minecraft for example is \"infinite\" and has enough depth you can put your head under while standing, and most AAA games are, quite deep and take you on an journeys regardless of how \"large\" pool is. And to put plainly NMS is kiddy pool infinite in size. Extremely simple and impossible to do more then one or to things with. Although on its own this game would make good early access $30 game, but the slew of missing content raise more questions then answers we have ever got from the Hello Games dev team e.g Planets orbiting, ships class system, naming ships, flight control that isn't a form of dumb down auto pilot, the depth and complexity of the crafting and elements system. Now based on what versions of the games with have seen threw trailers and \"gameplay footage\", it's looks as if the game has now become extremely simpler then the version we are playing now. Some reddititors have gone threw the footage from E3 and the likes, and have said that what we saw was very likely a real version of the game based some key artifacting that could of easily been removed in a pre baked animation e.g AA although this isn't 100% confirmed yet.This just my opinion, but it looks as if NMS has been effected by its need to run on the PS4, with the potential of Sony pulling strings forcing Hello games making the game simple to reach wider audiences and there for more buyers.With all this in mind it is best to hold on to that $60 USD till one of these things happen:1. They update the game bringing it closer to the E3 versions and promises made.2. They reduce the price, justifying the content or lack there of.3.

The Fnaf series has been an amazing horror, story driven indie games. Fnaf3 is packed full of challenges and hidden secretes, but this does not take away from the story or corrupt it. i like the feature of the devices failing and the hallucinations are awesome! People think these games are a one scare game you buy and leave, but it isn't because of fascinating story about the children murders and the fun and unique game devices. i rate the new installment 9,5/10.

The worst of it when defending is even if you have a general setup guarding that town and you get attacked you dont always spawn with your garrison units! they'll just be reinforcements! and at times they even spawn behind the enemy which can completely ruin any strategy, where's the logic in that? i've put 120 hours in this game and played on legendary difficutly and not once when an enemy has my city sieged have they ever attacked, they simply just wait for the attrition to kick in after numerous turns or wait for me to starve, thats pathetic.

While people complain about it being poorly optimised i have not yet had any problems with it however, A15 is focusing on optimisation while adding loads of new content, the console release was a bit buggy, but the devs have already fixed the bugs but cannot patch it because they are waiting for playstation to give them the all clear, all this is explained by Joel himself.The game is fantastic, and i look forward to every video and every new patch / Alpha that comes out, so if you're into survival games, this is one done right!Check out Joels videos for yourself!https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFrUPm0uNQgiPRos3TYOpEA"}]},{"0":"kanekicg","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kanekicg","2":[{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"423880","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted December 11, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Do you like wasting a few minutes of your life?

It's definately no doubt that I've enjoyed a lot with Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas in terms of the standalone games and the downloadable content.At least for me, I was able to buy the Season Pass of Fallout 4 on its initial price of almost 30 US dollars before Bethesda Softworks suddenly increased the price to almost 50 US dollars for some reason which I don't get.But take it from me, if you are really going to purchase the downloadable content from Fallout 4, it is wise to think ahead first if it's really worth it to consider buying Fallout 4's DLC."}]},{"0":"76561198082559637","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082559637","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","item_id":"250400","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted June 16, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Fun game for the amount you can get it  on sale, Single player is plain old but co-op is where it gets fun and there are some cool weapons you can craft as well."},{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"12 of 52 people (23%) found this review helpful","item_id":"332350","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted April 8, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Good DLC adds nice easy to use guns but the price is a little bit high"}]},{"0":"DKA013","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DKA013","2":[{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"208090","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted February 1, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"Cara esse jogo eh ♥♥♥♥ PACARAIO a jogabilidade 10, graficos 10, idea de jogo 10, o unico problema sao os servidores que estao passando por um problema de espaço ou seja a busca de partida deveria demorar 2 min no max, mas ela demora em torno de 7~9 minutos ou mais."},{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","item_id":"72850","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted January 6, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"Skyrim?

Yes.TL;DRBanished is a challenging (but fantastic) city builder which strays from the rest as it is not your typical city builder; instead of huge capital cities that we see in games like Cities: Skylines, Banished focuses on a small town with a low budget. Personally, I think it is one of the best games in the city building genre. That said, however, the AI of the villagers is rather mediocre, and at the moment there isn't a whole lot to it's (beautiful) bones. This game can provide hours of good, challenging fun, but don't come expecting anything like Cities: Skylines. Also note that this game is very hard, and may be frustrating to those new to the genre, even experienced city builders will also need to have a few tries to get used to it's somewhat complicated mechanics and challenge. Banished has a bit of a lack of tutorials, so don't expect that you will understand everything right away.Banished is fantastic and challenging, but don't come expecting another Cities: Skylines.After many tries and hours of understanding every little mechanic, I have finally formed a functional city with a good population. Yet in this game, someething, small or big, will fail, and everything will completely go down hill. That is the thing with Shining Rock Software's 2014 city builder Banished, there is and always will be an underlying threat. Whether it's famine, cold, a natural disaster, your town will eventually go to the pigs.Your town starts off with a few small, hopeful families, a storage barn, and a stock pile with not a hell of a lot of starting resources. You start off building a few small wooden houses, you make some gatherer's huts, forester lodges, nothing too big. Your town will slowly grow in population and size, and soon you have a city on your hands. However, don't expect it to be a Cities: Skylines type thing where you can just sit back and watch your city work, you need to keep your eyes on the game at all times. One time I had a town-wide famine, because the road from one of the gatherer's huts to the storage barn was too long. Couldn't understand why everyone kept dying of starvation. While it is occasionally very frustrating, it is a very addictive game, and sometimes when everything goes bad the game really shines. The dire need of resources, the feeling of hope, the game will immerse you. So, lets get into the pros and the cons.Pros-Addictive-Challenging-A blast of fresh air-Cool art style and general feel-Interesting seeing your town work and grow from the teamwork of all your villagers-Immersive-Lots to achieve and work to-Relatively simple-Pretty good map generation settings-Weather cycles which can mean life or death-Lots of different ways to approach things; you could use a gatherer to gather food from the forest, use aquired seeds to make farms, or maybe just buy all your resources off the trading post, you can decide-Villagers aren't just lifeless robots, they have needs and happiness which can be fulfilled in different ways-Natural disasters are a cool feature which you need to prepare for-Gives you a good overview of statistics in your townCons-Villager AI is mediocre at best-Not great control over a few different things like villager paths and resource management-Not a hell of a lot on it's bones yet-Lack of tutorials, just throws you in the deep end-UI can be a little hard to navigate-Some resources like rocks are not unlimited, and will eventually run out (this takes a long time though)-Annoying little bugs which can destroy your cityWell, that's basically that. Banished has a fair share of cons, just like any game, but I personally think it deserves a solid 8.5/10It serves as a fantastic ant farm simulator as well, seeing your people evolve and grow, seeing them get all wiped out (fun). It is one of my favourites in the city builder genre and any experienced city builder should pick up this game, but even newbies to the the genre can pick up this game and have fun."},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"314020","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted July 11, 2015.","recommend":false,"review":"Oh wonderful, a glitchy find an object game for 5 god damn dollars.11/10"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"223470","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted July 11, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Jimmy and Bobby had a bet.\"Bet you can't make a game with your eyes closed Jimmy!\" Said Bobby.Bobby was right.But this game is still fantastic."},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"57690","last_edited":"Last edited April 6, 2015.","posted":"Posted April 6, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Surprisingly, it's a really rather good city-builder*disclaimer, long and detailed review, skip to bottom for final verdictI got Tropico 4 in a humble bundle, kind've only wanting the other games in the bundle.

Once you clicked on them, a profile of the character came up, explaining their age, wellbeing, faction, name, where they work and where they live. It would also make the camera follow that person. Sometimes, I would find myself just seeing people go about their daily lives for hours on end.+In the population, there are structured families;A little more of a unnecessary part of the game, (but undoubtedly cool) was the structured families. Sometimes when checking people's profiles, you may find a group of people with the same last name. At first, I thought ths was just due to the developers not putting enough names in. But then, I executed a guy, and then everybody with the same last name as him got enraged. Confused, I looked at the effects of executing someone, and it said; \"victim's family will become enraged\" and thats when I realised, there was families, which is really cool!+A system where technology evolves with time;Much like Civilization V (which is an utterly fantastic strategy game), technology would advance as time goes on. This means, that I might start out with some crappy tenements, but when I research more stuff, I could have super high-tec shopping malls. Nuff said.+The ability of extreme POWER;In this game, you have the power of anything and everything on the island, (apart from the rebels, which we will get to later). None of the decisions will be made for you, you have to make them. There are recomendations for what to build, but I mostly found myself ignoring them, as sometimes they can screw you over.+Rebels;The rebels system in this game is rather good. It's simple, when someone becomes too unhappy with the island, they will become a rebel. Rebels can and will screw you over. They will start fires, attack buildings and people and generally become out of control.+Disasters;Perhaps copying other citybuilders, this game has disasters. Dont worry though, you won't be having meteors or aliens or...dinosaurs *cough*Simcity*cough*. Just normal things like nuclear bombs or volcano eruptions or earthquakes. And it won't just be mildly annoying either, it will seriously screw you over. Once, when I built my city next to a volcano, thinking it would look pretty cool, lets just say it wasn't cool when flying blobs of lava engulfed the city and I went financialy in debt.So, thats the list of things which I think are pretty cool in this game. Now, we will talk about the cons.Cons-Limited time;The thing I can think of straight off the bat is that it has a limited amount of time for a game, even in sandbox mode! Sure it is a while, but one time, I built a really great city...and then I couldn't play anymore because my \"mandate had run out\", and that was on maximum time. Sure, it adds realism, but sometimes fun should overweigh how realistic it is. This is where Just Cause 2 shined, now you might be thinking, \"what the devil, what on Earth has that got ot do with Tropico?!\" well, my friend; nothing. I was just bringing it up. Anyways, the reason Just Cause 2 was so fun is that it was completely unrealistic. Tropico should get some inspiration off that.-Lack of help;One of the annoying things about this game is that it just throws you in with \"build a city\". This is a large downside, as the game is quite complicated in the financial part of things. Alot of the time, I found myself looking at my amount of money, going down by the thousands, completely confused why.-Graphics;Now, I would like to point out that this is a very small and minor problem, especially considering it's a citybuilder. But the graphics are a little lacking.Final VerdictSo, we are down to the final verdict, and, if you couldn't already tell with the big blue thumbs up stamped on, I most certainly recomend Tropico 4! Even though it has flaws, I can still say this is a great, solid citybuilder. Thank you for taking some time to read this!"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"317360","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted January 28, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Glorious."},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"233130","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted January 4, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"My review of Shadow Warrior:Killed hordes of demons, birdmen that shoot fire and machine-gun wielding samuraisGot killed by a killer demon bunny11/10 would get killed by demon bunny again.No but seriously, this game is bloody damn awesome."}]},{"0":"DABLUICE","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DABLUICE","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"218620","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted November 13, 2015.","recommend":false,"review":"Bigger waste of money than a gym membership."}]},{"0":"BlitzGames","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlitzGames","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"249130","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted June 7, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"This Game is fantastic! although if you dont have a controller your fingers will break as the controls are mapped weirdly.

People who think poise was an OP feature for heavy builds, and then the people who thinks it's complete bs.Heavy armor's main advantage was Poise, allowing you to withstand hits without flinching, or slightly so untill you're staggered. Clerics, Sorcerers, Pyromancers and Warriors alike, were all hindered by this change to the 3rd installment.To this degree, you might as well as start off deprived and play through the entire game as is, or atleast use the Master's attire because armor reduction does jack all.I'm am gravely disappointed in Bandai Namco and From Software"},{"funny":"","helpful":"0 of 10 people (0%) found this review helpful","item_id":"58610","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted December 21, 2014.","recommend":false,"review":"If you were expecting a first person shooter it's not.

Seeing shadows of other players, interacting with their bloodspots on the ground to see how they died, getting summoned to another world to help slay a boss, and getting invaded by other players. PVP battles are incredibly tense, the tactics that worked on NPCs don't always work with players, and you know that the oponent you facing is no novice gamer.

The driving in this game feels a bit weighted, and the handling feels like you are trying to steer a bathtub with wheels. The drifting is pretty bad, as tapping the handbrake sends you in a slight drift that sometimes can be hard to get out and send you into a car, or tapping too much or holding the handbrake sends your car spinning out. The driving only missions where you have to do nothing but drive your car to the finish are way too long and tedious, and you will probably spend most of your time doing these, as they take 4-5 minutes, and you have to do them anyway to unlock more missions. After you complete these missions, you may feel like you don't want to play anymore as you spent 5 minutes of your life just driving a god damn car like you would in real life (unless you drive into other cars and into walls), in a video game.Speaking of missions, once you play more than an hour, you have experienced pretty much all what the game offers, except if you keep playing you just earn new cars and equipment upgrades. As of right now, I have not finished the game and I probably plan on not doing so. Also another annoying feature is the rubber banding of the police and racers. You can be as far ahead as you want, but the police seem like they have quad turbos with boost installed and will always catch up to you.The crashes in this game are pretty spectacular, as the game is made by the Burnout developers, Criterion Games and I feel like this is probably the best selling point of the game right here. If you are like me and enjoy watching cars crash in video games, then you can consider buying this game. There is nothing more satisfying than sending a car roll down the road and seeing the heap of metal stop dead, especially if the car costs more than your house.I have only played one game of multiplayer and I have probably experienced half of it. I only found one person (I am from Australia) and I was convinced that he was a hacker. I played as police, and he ignored all my roadblocks and spike strips and literally passed through them like a ghost. I also think that he was using speed hacks and was pretty much untouchable as he zoomed by me. This part is probably why I am going to not recommend this game.  In the start of the game, it asks you to sign up or login into an existing EA account. Me being stupid, I put in the wrong email associated to the account and it made me an entirely new account with an extremely generic name that I cannot change the name of. So every time I want to play this game, it always asks me to sign up or sign in and I cannot get around that other than putting in a fake username and password to ask if it wants to start me offline and it bugs the hell out of me. Also I found out that it  FORCES  you to use a microphone and webcam, so they basically breach your privacy while you play. The only way around this is, is to disable them if you dont want them to be used.I alt+tab out of games alot, and for me, I found out that my fps drops significantly to about 10-20 fps if I alt+tab in any part of the game, even the unskippable intro scene (which is also annoying). I don't know if other people have these problems, but this is a heads up.Overall, the game is pretty decent, good graphics for a 2010 game, one of the best crash physics, sub-par steering and handling and if you find people in multiplayer, (which i doubt) then I hope you have a better experience than mine. This game gets really stale if you play for too long, so I recommend to play it once in a while to get your racing fix. I would probably recommend this game, but shame that these problems had to occur during my playtime.I give this game 6/10"}]},{"0":"shay181","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shay181","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","item_id":"287390","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted December 2, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"I love the metro game's and this is a must it feels right and every moment your in the game you feel like your staring in a movie i hope more metro games come out coz if they keep it going like this then im in"},{"funny":"","helpful":"0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","item_id":"304930","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted October 6, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"for a free 2 play game i must say it is fun i play this alot with my friends and there's alot to do and now that there's a workshop for the game there's alot more to do it my not look like the best game in the world but the gameply is good building stuff in the game is amazing"}]},{"0":"degen97","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/degen97","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","item_id":"6060","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted December 26, 2013.","recommend":true,"review":"best star wars LAN game ever"}]},{"0":"76561197994831363","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994831363","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"468240","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted June 25.","recommend":true,"review":"Really miss virtual sailer, which wasn't VR but was the best sailing game out there.I jumped in to have a look at VR Regatta and like the other reviews,  I know it has great potential.If this game goes MP, I'm in.

I do, like a lot of people, have a lot of other larger games installed so I checked them to see if that was pushing me over quota. They weren't. I then checked some of the smaller games, one of which was Payday 2. It now holds the record of being the largest game that i've ever installed, and since every new microtransa- I mean, 'update' they add puts another 5gb-9gb on my disk, I decided to uninstall.The microtransactions, while I didn't find them irritating at first, now they are holding the game down. The GOTY edition helped, but 'helping' a problem and 'fixing' a problem are two different things. On a 75% off sale, the DLC is $33. Unacceptable. Don't get me wrong though, this is a fun game, and I've sunk 257 hours into messing around with mates as a result of that.

I absolutely love it. The artsyle is charming, the music sets the scene nicely and the story, while sometimes lacking, is overall extremely well written. The one complaint I have with these three games (yes, you get three games for $3), is that they are too short. I completed them all in under 4h, and then proceeded to re-play the games a few times to get all the achievements, and for my own personal enjoyment. Fantastic value for the price of a chocolate bar, it's too bad that Miwashiba will not make any more of these. LiEat IV is a light novel that you can find with a google search, but Miwashiba stated that she won't make any more games. It's just too bad that such a fantastic developer doesn't want to make any more. I would buy any LiEat game in a heartbeat."},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"221640","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted May 17, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"This little, extremely inexpensive arcade game is worth the entire $3 I spent on it. In all seriousness, this game has been with me for a while and I have gifted it to a few people in an attempt to get the highest score between all of us, not an easy task. This game combines addictive chiptunes with BRUTAL gameplay that will make you want to smash your head into your keyboard, then pick up the remains and stab it. Multiple times. Who ever thought surviving one minute could be so difficult? Obviously not me!Pros:-Addictive gameplay-Competitive gameplay for the highest score in your group-Great soundtrack-Wonderful color palette (in my oppinion)Cons:-Too short-Once the patterns are memorized it becomes significantly easier-I only find myself playing for about 30-40min at a timeRating: 8/10.

The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot.But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that."},{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"42680","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted May 28.","recommend":true,"review":"One of the best ''Boots on the ground'' call of duties out there."},{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"550","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted June 19, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"This is a great game to play with friends."},{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","item_id":"319630","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted March 14.","recommend":true,"review":"Amazing game, The music fits this game really well.Made me tear up at some points in the game."},{"funny":"","helpful":"0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","item_id":"379720","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted May 28.","recommend":true,"review":"This game is great and all but.. where is the Jumpscares!?"},{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","item_id":"218620","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted September 1, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Great game to play with friends."},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"266010","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted July 9, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Lets be honest, you bought this game so you could spell something on your Achievement Showcase."},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"235460","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted March 28, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Don't buy this game for $30.Wait for the price to go down and then buy it.

Bleed is a small 2d platformer where you control the character known as Wryn who wants to become the Greatest Hero of All Time but the heroes have already been chosen so you have to go and kill them and take you rightfull place. It is also a fast-paced action platformer which involves loads of bullets and enemies being thrown at you while you while having bullet time and control over your character at which in no point in time is trying to screw you over. The Game also and upgrades and weapons that you can purchase with points by playing the levels.With everything but the kitchen sink coming towards your general direction it can be quite difficult trying to avoid it and you will die quite a bit at the start (Either I just suck or I'm telling the truth) but unlike most games where it insults you for dying, it doesn't really do it in Bleed, Infact half the time Wryn is actually conforting me for my loss saying things like \"Don't worry we'll get them next time\"The Bullet time mechanic is really quite neat and helpful and also quite balanced. There is a separate bar for bullet time: Using it in short bursts will allow it to recharge a little and you will be able to use it again, Use it untill the bar goes to zero and you will have to wait untill it refills again to use bullet time once more and that could involve getting hurt when you needed it the most.I've also noticed the game is very generous in check points meaning it will not send you to the very beginning of that room or level, it's as if the developer knew that it might be a tad bit difficult on players. Now I can't really explain how it all works but just play the game and you will see what I mean.The soundtrack in this game is fantabolus (yes I purposely did that) there is not a single song that I didn't like. It fits in with the enviroment it is placed in and it has that old school 8-bit feel to it, especially the boss music.There is also Co-op in this game, I don't anyone else to play with so yea :C but I had a look on youtube and it's quite nice. Still don't know how it works but it looks good.I have no complaints about this game: It has great fulid control, awesome soundtrack, fast-paced gameplay, a good challenge and a good price. There is however one thing that I am not fond of and that is the length of the game. while there are other things like arcade, challenge mode and other difficulties to play on, I just find this game to be a little to short and could have been better game than what is already was but hey, don't let that stop ya from buying this game cuz it is worth the price.In conclusion I think that this is a great game to play and I had fun every single second of it and for 4.99 Its worth it all the way.........Well what are you waiting for? Go buy it already!"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"333930","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted July 23, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Super Team Fortress Combat: Global OffensiveThat doesn't force you to spend your real-life moneyand really fun"},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"329490","last_edited":"Last edited October 13, 2015.","posted":"Posted May 29, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"This is as close as I'm going to get in regards to have Scott Pilgrim vs the World on PC. That being said Phantom Breaker is its own game and what a fun game it is.It's a beat-em up game with anime-like characters and awesome chip-tune music. The Game can be a bit repetive for some but I love it none the lessPros: -Music-Characters: really fun to use and you can unlock more of them in storymode-2D graphics look gourgeous-Gameplay-Stages are really nice.-Multiplayer (haven't really tested it since at the moment its only local at the moment)-Skill Point system-Lengthy: not one of those games you can really complete in one day.-Making combos is awesome.Middlepoint-Later enemies are reskins of previous ones but they have their differences and look interesting. Not just some palette swap-Controls and mechanics are a bit confusing in how they work but it's enough to have fun with.-The Storymode for a single character can go on for a bit, not to long but your hands will get a tad bit tired afterwards.- The game tends to bunch a crapload of enemies into one room and with the weird guarding mechanic working only for some attacks it can get a bit difficult. Still you should enjoy beating the hell out of them with combos.- The Story is bloody confusing for these characters. Either way still interesting.Cons-Remember when I spoke about the whole controls and mechanics thing. Yea some attacks it will block but for bigger guys or stronger attacks dodging it is very hard. Not to mention dodging itself is difficult and you can be beaten the crap out of by enemies. -You will find later on these weird blue/red ball enemies that have these tape claws or something. The mechanics make it either very difficult or impossible to avoid their attacks. That might just be me but its annoying none the less.-You better have a Controller for this because this is one of those games where the PC keyboard inputs are placed in weird places, The control help shows a console controller and you can not change the inputs at all. So yea, Have fun.-Difficulty Spikes on these bosses go up quite a bit and with the confusing mechanics. It can be difficult.As you can see this game has quite flaws but don't let that stop you. I had a lot of fun playing this and with the online mode being annouced recently, maybe soon I'll have friend to play with. It's my kind of game. maybe not to all, but at least to me. Though I would recommend buying it when it goes on sale like what I did.Overall I think the game gets a 7/10. Not the best but no where near bad at all. Bad is not a word you would describe this game with.

And that's where the fun comes from, not the hiding and the stakes of being found, but trying to find the quickest and easiest way to the objective through utilisation of the environment. The story is clever, well written, but short. the level design is top-notch, and with the implementation of a steam workshop supported level editor, I can see a much longer playtime through the various community levels.Oh, and you get a TF2 hat.So, even if you don't like stealth games, there's a demo that you can test the water with.

The only thing I can say is     GOOD LUCK and DON'T Starve and Freeze to Death."},{"funny":"3 people found this review funny","helpful":"5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","item_id":"367500","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted August 19.","recommend":true,"review":"^ Add to Cart button is up there. ^"},{"funny":"2 people found this review funny","helpful":"7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","item_id":"225600","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted May 6.","recommend":true,"review":"Fun game, just needs more damn players ^_^"}]},{"0":"76561198090773476","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198090773476","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"107900","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted January 28, 2015.","recommend":false,"review":"Not the worst game.

I have noticed a lot of negative reviews that say \"this game is bad because Queue times are long and not enough players\", that is not to the problem, these people are the problem, they dont have enough patience to wait for the player group to get bigger so queue times are short. This is a game where you have to be in it for the long haul to reap the rewards as such. I highly reccommend this game as it has great controls and is generally wonderful. It is rather accurate representations of historic ships, such as the tier 9 battleships, Yamato(Japanese) is strongest in armour and damage but rather slow, Iowa(USA) is fast with less armour and slightly less damage, the H39(German) is a mix of both, only one that is slightly out is the british Lion because that was a WW1 Battleship so it has had to be 'promoted' to be a tier 9. All the ammunition is correct as well, such as torpedoes do lots of damage and allow the hull to be breached, thus slowing the enemy down(this can be repaired by the enemy). However, the one problem i find is that the developers turn a blind eye to hacking, yes there is hacking in this game, which ruins it at times. The hacks are basic ones for now, none that increase damage or instant kill ones, but mainly to do with scouting ranges. If enough people report it im sure the developers will finally get interested and try to fix it.THIS IS NOT A P2W GAME. I must say that, yes paying money helps to get things such as advanced smoke (this lasts longer than normal smoke). However, you do not need to spend any to reach high tiers, I myself have reached Tier 9, almost Tier 10 and havent spent a penny on it."},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"365810","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted July 10.","recommend":true,"review":"For new release game this has started off well, it has lots of potential. 2 different modes, arcade - slightly aided in a way for fun and people who are still learning, then a second mode which gives the player more control over there plane, much more hands on. This game is good and I love what i have played of it. it is very challenging however because i play using controller. Im not sure if its just because my controller is an xbox one or its the game setup but the control sensitivity is seriously twitchy, even on the lowest setting (0) it is almost impossible to get a smooth steady turn going. Even the slightest flick moves your plane about 10 - 20 degrees around a circle, this makes targetting a dodging plane very hard. Also it is slightly laggy, my laptop isnt the best, i will admit, this won't help, but your planes movement is juddery, move your controls and your plane sort of \"jumps\" across the sky in small leaps. Even on the lowest settings it is still the same.Finally, dont come into this game expecting some HD quality with magnificent details, trees exist but are more or less just blurry green things, buildings are super basic looking and its generally looks like a game from about 6 years ago. Slightly like GTA San Andreas quality with a tiny bit more clarity.I reccommend this game alot, definite potential to take top spot as best flying game/ WW2 plane game out, however, i suggest you wait until they fixed it up a bit and slightly improved the genral gameplay and controls."}]},{"0":"76561198049435011","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049435011","2":[{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"271590","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted January 27.","recommend":true,"review":"I started my own company where we help fat people move around the city by lifting them up with forklifts and taking them to their destinations (see my screenshot)."},{"funny":"","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"236390","last_edited":"Last edited August 28.","posted":"Posted April 8, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"Despite the 1.37 update which earned my negative review, the developers have changed my mind and earn back my positive review with the improved flight models, damage system, more aircrafts and the tanks are added into War Thunder finally.

I accused it of suffering from a \"terrible lack of content\", primarily due to the fact that it only had \"4 classes, one which was broken\" (Zerker).I dare say that I've played enough of the new update to wish that I'd waited until the patch had been released before giving this game a negative rating.This is due to the fact that yes, Tripwire did take a long time in releasing it, and yes, there was a lack of content in time waiting for the new update, however, I can honestly say that it was all worth it.Every second.The new content is incredible, the Zerker tree has been completely re-worked, and it now functions as well as any other class in the game. The FLEX Gore system is beautiful (THE GIBS, MAN, THE GIBS).The new maps are unbelievably well-done. Catacombs is an underground area (as you'd expect from the name) where almost every light can be destroyed, plunging the map into almost complete darkness. It is claustrophobic, nigh on terrifying when played on the hardest difficulty, adrenaline pumping, and indescribably enjoyable to play.Evacuation Point is just as well done, but it isn't as original as Catacombs. Whilst it is beautifully made, with some lovely tight spots to get stuck in, there is little that differs it from the rest of the maps, whilst Catacombs is one of the most unique maps I've ever had the pleasure of suffering through.The two new classes are absolutely spectacular. Firebug is fun in a maniacal sort of way. Setting countless Zeds aflame with the Flamethrower and watching them writh around as they slowly burn to death always succeeds in elicting a psychotic grin on my face. The Microwave Gun is just, beautiful.Simply beautiful.There is nothing more enjoyable in Killing Floor 2 than watching a Zed inflate spectacularly before bursting into a satisfying shower of gibs and bodily fluids. And then there's the Demolitionist. Whilst the class could do with some re-working (it is a tad underpowered currently), I can't honestly say that I don't enjoy laying down C4 at chokepoints and waiting expectantly for a group of Zeds to walk by before blowing them all to smithereens, their intenstines flying all over the place, their blood splattering the walls as I giggle with glee behind the keyboard. Ahem. Aside from the brilliant new content, there were numerous bug-fixes and other improvements present. Namely, Tripwire did away with (or at least reduced the effect of) Zed Teleporting, which was one of my primary reasons for giving the game a negative rating. Furthermore, they improved Han's' intro, along with some of his attacks, visual effects, and other things. This, amongst with countless other improvements, all work spectacularly, with nary a bug in sight. I've gotta say Tripwire, I'm very bloody impressed."}]},{"0":"riseofnations231","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/riseofnations231","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","item_id":"730","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted September 3, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"Great Game to play with friends and to have heaps of fun"}]},{"0":"Efreak","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Efreak","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","item_id":"207250","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted July 5, 2012.","recommend":true,"review":"A great game, but a little too casual, if anything.

Não só a gameplay dele que é legal, o desenho e a arte dele são incríveis e pixelizadas.

Also raise up a great reflection, worth give up of college, family, friends and of live your always-life just for do what you like and be paid for it?Even if you're not a DotA player watch this, worth so much, I honestly don't play but is the second time that I see since was released last year and is amazing the way they retract and show what is e-sports, furthermore is just 1h29min.:D :)   Análise em português :Melhor documentário sobre o que é e-sports, apesar de o foco ser APENAS no DotA, já mostra o quão incrível é essa área. Quem diria que um simples jogo pode se transformar em algo grande como um torneio mundial.Esse filme não serve apenas para DotA mas para os jogos competitivos em geral. E também levanta uma grande reflexão, será que vale a pena deixar os estudos de lado, família, amigos e de viver a sua vida de sempre para fazer o que você gosta e ser pago por isso?Mesmo que você não jogue DotA assista esse documentário, vale muito a pena, eu não jogo mas é a segunda vez que assisto desde quando lançou ano passado e é inacreditável a maneira que eles retratam e o mostram o que são e-sports, além do mais é apenas 1h29m.:D :)"},{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"No ratings yet","item_id":"249870","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted October 11, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"O primeiro foi melhor, mas esse segundo não deixa de ser bom, ainda mais com toda essa imersão do universo DC.

The only slight criticism I have, is that the only way to get the random powerups is to enter some obscure \"cheat code\", which i always felt was a massive part of the game originally. However outside of that, I cannot fault the gameplay.

Do you realize how monumental this game was (and seemingly still is) to gamers and even to Valve themselves? Steam Achievement and later drop system along with hats were first introduced for TF2. I remember when hat phenomenon was all over the place and everyone wanted Fancy Fedora so much.Here is one fun story about the game; A guy from SourceOP known as Drunken F00l got VAC-banned for making idling tool for TF2 and for cheating an event item known as Golden Wrench. Including him, people who used idling tool got their hats and items taken away meanwhile all other active TF2 players were awarded with Halo hats for not using the tool. But after sometime the ban on the SourceOP guy was lifted and he officially started working at Valve for his TF2 Backpack and something more. Well, that guy had talent and Valve definitely knew about it so they decided to hire him in spite of all violations of user agreements as a Steam user. It reminds me of the FBI hiring a genius financial fraudster and there is even a movie about it. So much drama over TF2, aye? You see, this game just has so many interesting stories to tell.When TF2 switched to F2P model, the community even got bigger and stronger than ever before and it is still growing even after many years have passed. All official updates and endless user-created contents enrich the game; more drops, more hats, more weapons, more maps, more Halloween and holiday events, more updates, more everything, and now skins just like in CS:GO; OMG VOLVO. And its market is being sustained on its own economy. Quite amazing. I personally no longer play this game anymore because I already played enough of it, but it is easily understandable why this game is still one of the most played games on Steam..

For those kiddies at home new to roguelikes, it means randomised within programmed constraints.Now, the enviornments look great (despite being skinned similar) when you're fighting your way through it, it feels cool. But the nature of procedural generation is that the clever placement of enemies is impossible in a game like this. I'm going to resort to the \"Dark Souls comparison\" thing here, Dark Souls enemies are placed in a genius fashion; they make you take risks and assess your situation. This game just feels like someone had a big box of vikings, giant spiders and robots and went \"WOOPS I dropped them all over my maze, eh, some adventurer will clean them up\". You'll never feel like the enemies are using the environment against you, you'll never look at a group of enemies and think of a way to get past them. The way to get past them is always the same; run at them and mash attack til they die (Optional: Heal afterwards, but you are invincible anyway (more on that below!))Even in a game like Destiny, you're forced to think about what enemy you're fighting, and adjust your tactic. But in Necropolis the tactic for every type of enemy is exactly the same; hit a bunch, dodge to the side, or special attack in groups. There is both not enough enemy types and very little change in how you fight them. Even when there's vikings, wizards, robots, and skeletons all at once, all you do is hit them til they fall down. The only time they ever change is by health amount (to pretty ridiculous levels of grindy health) and minor reskins. Oh yeah, enemies also never ever block or stop you from attacking, SO GO NUTS.It also bugs me to no end that one of the only things you use currency, which is gems, for in this game is to level up (AKA, get more health), but by level 6 (of 9) you are already max level. So what do you spend the rest of your gems on? You don't. You can buy crafting recipes or potions and that's it. You will very soon have 8,000 gems in one playthrough that you literally can't do anything with.For a game with 'difficult' on the tags, I expected this to take more than 3 tries playing solo (in my second try, the game just never gave me an armour drop 'just cuz', so I lost). You have infinite healing items because you can just craft meat to eat, I had somewhere around 50 pieces of meat I could use to craft more healing at the end of the game. And for a game with 'rogue-like' in the title, I expected there to be more randomized RPG elements. There are four tiers of items; the higher the tier, the better the item, no exceptions. The fact that there's so many armour types, but only 4 actual armour classes wastes the potential of all the different sets they hand out. Why not a passive for each armour set? Why, because of the obvious reason; you wouldn't be able to figure out what the passive does without reading the wiki because of the \"I'm a smartass\" goofy text that makes almost every item wholly confusing. I get it; the weapons and armour have been kept intentionally simple so you don't sit reading inventory screens for years, but the lack of item variety also effects my willingness to replay it again.The most insulting part about calling it a roguelike is that you are practically invincible! You get a resurrection potion. Yes. A potion where you can keep going when you died. Oh I'm sorry, did I say A potion, I meant the ability to craft infinite resurrection potions. Which, again, would be less of a big deal if you didn't have infinite crafting ingredients on you at all times because every enemy spews out craft confetti so you'll never be short on anything but inventory space.I sound a bit salty, because I am. I was really looking forward to this, it had a lot of potential. Do I ever think I'll play it again? No, probably not, unless all my buddies end up with it in a humble or something. For $30, you're half way to the 40 hour long Dark Souls 3, not to mention all the other roguelikes that you can get for half that price, which offer a lot more content. Sorry guys; it was a good attempt but fell short of what it could've been."}]},{"0":"tyrone266","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tyrone266","2":[{"funny":"3 people found this review funny","helpful":"1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","item_id":"440","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted December 8, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"I've only played for a tiny bit, its pretty good."}]},{"0":"Frankaloons","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frankaloons","2":[{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"107410","last_edited":"Last edited June 29.","posted":"Posted February 23, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"Arma 3 is a military simulation game. Let me tell you about it.First of all, some history.All of these titles lasted a few years, with continuing updates.Operation Flashpoint came out in 2001, and was a very good game for it's time.ARMA: Armed Assault was released in 2006, and was also a very good game.ARMA 2 was released in 2009, and was probably the best WW2 shooter out there, if not the best shooter, and is still being played today.Arma 3 was released in 2013. Now, this little game is seriously the next gen stuff. With amazing graphics and sounds, a new story-rich campaign, a futuristic setting and beautiful, lush terrain on huge maps is what made it stand out at the time.The game is set in the republic of Altis and Stratis, which are both small Greek islands, although they're MASSIVE for a game's map. There are three teams fighting for these islands, first of all are the locals, the AAF or Independents. They are the Altan Army Forces, and, because pressured by their local guerilla crisis, have made some European and American allies, NATO, or BLUFOR. Although, towards the end of the first episode of the campaign, there are 'entanglements' and the AAF decide to turn on NATO, and then CSAT, a a combination of Asian forces, teams with the AAF. Also, NATO is having a financial crisis. Oh, what fun.It has a few original gamemodes, which were released with the game originally, but so many more have come from the vast modding community.Altis Life, Wasteland, Invade and Annex and Breaking Point are just a few examples. I'll tell you a little bit about each.First of all, Altis Life. It's a very exadurated take on real life. With cops, medics and civilians. As a civilian, you can make your money in legal ways, like apple picking and mining with a liscence, although you can make it in illegal ways like drugs and turtle poaching. You can also go to a rebel town and buy some illegal gear and do more illegal things.As a cop, you'll have to stop all this illegal behaviour. Doing searches and inforcing the law, rebels will have to look out for these guys.And medics, if you're injured, can come and revive you. May sound simple, but it's actually a very dangerous job.Here's a very good Altis Life server: http://reignofterrorclan.enjin.com/With Wasteland, you have your three teams, BLUFOR, OPFOR and Independent.As BLUFOR or OPFOR, you have to work together with your team to kill the other team and the Independents, while getting money from missions or killing players to buy new things, like guns and veichles.As an independent, you're in a massive free for all against the other teams and all the other independents, unless you group up with some others.Here's a very good Wasteland server: https://www.gametracker.com/server_info/play.ultimatewasteland.com:2302/With Breaking Point, it's a zombie game, so basically DayZ. DayZ started as an Arma 2 mod, which eventually became a standalone game. Now, however, it's also an Arma 3 mod. Scavenge for supplies, kill or befriend other players while watching out for zombies.Sign up to play here: http://www.thezombieinfection.com/Also, Invade and Annex is more of a slow paced military simulation. With classes, you can pick your role and fight against enemy AI for the islands. Using all of the game's original content and a little bit more, this gamemode is seriously some good fun if you're more of a strategic fighter.It is overall an ultra realistic game, with tons of veichles, models and weapons, even very realistic weather and day - night cycles, and there's a lot more stuff from the modding community. It has a really steep price at $60, but I picked it up on special, and even if I did buy it for the original price, it's worth it. Trust me, it's worth it.If my horrible explanation didn't help you, check out the Arma 3 Youtube channel. If it did help you, check it out anyway.https://www.youtube.com/user/Arma3officialThanks for reading my review and, if you decide to get the game, I hope to see you!Frank"},{"funny":"1 person found this review funny","helpful":"2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"4000","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted July 28, 2014.","recommend":true,"review":"Okay, so I'm hearing you ask \"Why should I buy Garry's Mod?\" Well, you'd find that a silly question too if you'd been through the same experience some of us have been.And now, I just want to say, the reason I'm writing this review is because it's one of my favourite games. My favourite, probably. But I also want you to know I could say \"I recommend this game, it's awesome\" and be done with it. But that's not what makes you want to buy a game.So, first off, a history lesson. Garry's Mod started off as a mod for Half Life 2. You play through standard Half Life 2, whilist spawning in whacky inventions to help you along the way. It's so much more than that now.It still runs off the same Half Life 2 game engine, like CS:S and TF2 do. I guess it would be classified an FPS sandbox game. But you can change that.You can spawn in classic Half Life 2 props, weapons, entities, npcs, spawn in other peoples creations, go into other people's worlds, try out some other classic gamemodes like Jailbreak, Trouble in Terrorist Town or DarkRP.There are also lots of things that aren't from the Half Life 2 game in sandbox. Tools. Weld, duplicate, face posing, weight and so many more.What's that you say? You want more? We can handle that too. This is where the game really shines. Addons. If you go onto the main menu, they'll be a tab called 'Addons'. This is where you can keep all of other players, and you're own creations and mods. Modern Weapons, cars, nuclear missiles! Without addons, you would only have standard sandbox. All gamemodes, such as Melonbomber, TTT, HL2RP, Zombie Survival etc. couldn't exist without addons!Some textures and props you can't get through addons which is understandable for this kind of sandbox game. For CS:S props, you need CS:S. There's DOD, TF2, L4D, HL, DH, etc. Once you have these mounted, (main menu, click the game controller, and tick the boxes in the list) just go into your singleplayer sandbox, and there, in the main props list, will be the ragdolls, props etc. from the games.I reckon this pretty much concludes my very brief review of the game that is Garry's Mod.

Although, if you want to make a much more enjoyable experience for yourself and the players, or if you think the editor is too fiddly and hard to use, use Zeus.Zeus allows you to use the default editor, but in 3D, with easier to use placement and editing panels.

It is true that people buying star forge should consider the fact it is in alpha but that being said, the game itself is barely in a playable state. The world's are dull and lifeless, lacking any sort of explorability past the opening area despite the game advertising \"procedural voxel terrain\". The game is set on the premise of a survival game in which enemies come in waves. This sounds pretty standard in theory and seems like an easy basis for a game but StarForge manages to get it all wrong. The waves are slow and tedious, the enemies lack variety and any sort of intelligent A.I and the weapons are dreadful. I have never played a game with gun mechanics as bad as StarForge, they're just dreadful.The enemies have basic animations which don't show when it is actually in a state of death so you are often left shooting the enemy for prolonged periods of time as the fact is, the enemies animations don't show life even when it should be living. You control horrendously in StarForge. Moving, one of the simplest of tasks, is made hard by sluggish movement and bad mouse control. The saturation of motion blur is almost sickening and the lack of any choice to turn it off just makes it even worst. StarForge however does one thing interesting with the movement which is in the form of ragdoll-esque falling. It can provide some laughs as you fly into objects and spaz the hell out when falling but is anything but a good gameplay feature and more of a humerous addition. The games building is a clunky system which like most of the games systems works great in theory but fails to pratically work.  The simple idea of cube-based building is ruined by the games approach to the building system as well as a lack of world modification which seems like something the game needed from the start. StarForge makes a lot of promises and doesn't deliver on any of them to the point where writing this review felt more like a winge as I could not think of one thing I liked about the game. One can only hope that in future updates the game gains some sort of solidity but the fact of the matter is that StarForge isn't playable by any stretch of the imagination and a lot of work will need to be put in to give it's buyers a reason to enjoy it."}]},{"0":"iConnor_","1":"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iConnor_","2":[{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"291550","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted June 25.","recommend":true,"review":"Vikings!"},{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful","item_id":"440","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted April 21, 2015.","recommend":true,"review":"This is a wonderful F2P FPS, it has a wonderful texture and it is outragously enjoying.i have alot of fun playing this, and the i know the develepers can and will make the game alot better and more enjoyable in the future."},{"funny":"","helpful":"1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","item_id":"346110","last_edited":"","posted":"Posted January 27.","recommend":true,"review":"The things i like about this game, are its Open World, Theres freedom to create and destroy wondeful creations/bases, you can tame almost ALL dinos in the list of many.
