This games soundtrack is fully orchestral and imersive. The music just fits perfectly where-ever you are in game. Whether you are spelunking or just flying through the vast expanse of space it fits perfectly and leaves you in awe.Ok onto the graphics: The look and feel of this game bring the vast worlds to life with the many colors and alien dirts, trees and the mixture of monsters. The backgrounds of the planets match up the the foregrounds well and give the 2d aspect that 3d feel.Now the gameplay: Starbound has a nice rich layer of gameplay revolving around survival. In the latest unstable build updates they have introduced a very needed layer of missions and npc quests which fullfil the gaps of just flying from planet to planet and give purpose.Starbounds worlds have a wide variety of random aspects to them.First off the flora: Flora of planets consists of 2-3 main aspects. The Trees, the small bushes and medium bushes. Each planet has a vast difference to the next in their flora with trees coming in 2-3 different types from metallic trees to plain out alien tentacles.Now onto the fauna: Each planet has 3 or more ground based animals which increase in strength further beneath the planets surface. Starbound has a feature where animals are customized via their limbs and body. There are many arms, legs, feet and bodies all just jumbled to together from monster to monster making cute monsters and just plain out terrifying ones. There are also around 2 bird species per planet. Using the same general system.I personally suggest this game because of its deep and fluid experience and its wide modding community.8-9/10 for an early access and its only going to get better!","4":"PPanther","key":45,"index":45},{"0":"440","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"Best first person shooter","4":"devvonst","key":46,"index":46},{"0":"218740","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"Well, need a multiplayer option","4":"devvonst","key":47,"index":47},{"0":"550","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"AWESOME","4":"devvonst","key":48,"index":48},{"0":"238090","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"One of the best sequals i have every seen, rebellion dose a great job of refining and improving. the X-ray mechanic is vastly improved.One thing in particular i dont like is the new leveling system and having to unlock weapons, but then again it gives the game massive replayabily through the open-ended levels making you want to go back for more and get those weapons, but personal opinion i like V2's weapon unlock system.great game worth every dollor, 9/10","4":"starkillershadow553","key":49,"index":49},{"0":"277430","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"For $5 this game is worth your time.Pretty easy to pick up and play with simple controls and fun gameplay. dont be worried that the game will be runied by microtranactions cause they dont really change the game at all.Graphics have a really nice feel the them and sound is really good.Hopfully this game will pave the path for future halo games to come to PC.","4":"starkillershadow553","key":50,"index":50},{"0":"8870","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"1.

This is still up for a little improvementsMods can be very fun and after finishing the story i reccomend installing one after finnishing the story.However you should install an ENB asap because it greatly enhances the graphics.","4":"76561198054540475","key":66,"index":66},{"0":"265210","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"In an alternate universe when Ronald Mcdonald was not sucsessful.19/21","4":"76561198054540475","key":67,"index":67},{"0":"48700","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"I Have Played 60 hours of this brilliant different type of strategy game and i haven't had enough.

With the help of the hl2 engine, the graphics, models of weapons and characters, this deserves one of the best shooters game of all time. As well as this, map-making is avaliable to all people who are willing to do it, same with plugins for custom servers, Source Film Maker and many more things. This is overall a stunning game that I have played for a while and deserves a yes. GG Valve.Some things that may put it down, however, would be the fact that some recent updates are very similar in terms of style. For example, the Gun Mettle update brought in contracts, new maps, etc. The halloween update brought in the same thing, but just different missions.People who play other shooter games, that are like COD, Battlefield, etc. One thing i would have to say to those people would be, don't shout at the medic to run to you and specifically YOU because apparantely YOU are the one carrying the team with your gibus and goggles and your natascha, family business and your eviction notice. Pub doesnt work like that, sunshine.As well as this, don't be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to the new kid or some ♥♥♥♥ just because you got screwed over when you were new. At some point this new kid will have a better inventory, (yes i know just because having an expensive inventory doesnt make you a better player) better items, and a better fighting style. TF2 doesnt need those kinds of ♥♥♥♥♥ on their servers.Either way, although there are some parts of the years to come that will be lazy, there will be better things introduced. Frankly, i want some new weapons, they've been just introducing reskins.

So at first i wasnt so keen on ubisoft relaseasing another game so shortly after Unity, which i think i speak for everyone, despite an attempt at a next-gen engine, it was still average at best. Rogue to me feels like im playing the best bit of the AC franchise, The ship from AC4 and the same unchanged New York map from AC3 to name a few. Some elements from previous multiplayer have also been added in, despite there being an actual multiplayer. My main attractions to Rogue would be the tie-ins to other parts of the franchise, the expansion on the Kenway saga from Black Flag, the Birth of Achillies and his part in AC4 (seems like a sequel, Fast and Furious flash back anyone, *cough* Han *cough*). This also raises another issue i have however, these connections seem very much like Ubisoft are tying loose end to the AC4 and AC3 series, which we saw happen in revelations. Obviosuly this game is far better than Revelations, but is it? im not saying rogue is a cash cow but if the same thing is happening again and ubisoft are working on something in the background, Rogue is nothing more than a slight o' hand (see the pirate reference?), a very visually appealing one at that, they went pretty hard out with this one, even if it is just tying up loose ends and mamking the whole Benjamin Franklin and Achilies issues seem more realistic, it was worth it. Touching on that further, despite being released after PS3/4 and XB360/1, Rogue also had a lower realease cost, which also leads me to believe there is more in store for his franchise, this is in no way the end, ubisoft opened a can of worms by releasing the Templar play with Shay and i personally think it will breathe new light into a somewhat dying franchise.Some things i disagree with:- Bring back the crouch, creates a better sense of realism, i literally walked passed enemies and no one even battered an eye lid. (not legit)- Bring back multiplayer, even if it was only the sailing, i would play that for hours. Seriously, that would have made this game epic. - Hunting is no fun, i dont know anyone who enjoys the hunting challenges.Give this one a go, if you liked the ship from AC4 and Black Flag then its even better here Rogue, Also there is less \"land play\" which made me happy.Have to congratulate Ubisoft here, well rounded game, stable enough for a PC version of AC, playable and enjoyable. P.s Dont take the ship away again.Cheers,Lordelicious.","4":"Lord_Exploit","key":203,"index":203},{"0":"322170","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"Awesome game, very addictive and truely immerisve.

It was fun, pretty buggy, but it was full of promise. Skip forward a few years later. The game is worse. Lets talk about starting the game. The game is slow to start. Starting a game will take just as long, and when you get into the game itself, prepare for unoptimized slowness. The game runs terribly, is riddled with bugs and the devs generally don't add any new content. If this was developed by a good indie team, or an AAA team (Oh, did i forgot to mention they fired several people who worked at Bioware, and hired some scrubs?), it would be amazing. The concept is great, I would have really looked forward to this game shining, but the devs are horrible.

Es allí donde se encuentra el Cristal “GG-3883”, un mineral del planeta Xen que fue capturado para una investigación. Cuando todo marchaba “normalmente” ocurre una pequeña tormenta de portales dentro de la cámara de pruebas seguido de una gran explosión que afecta a todo el sector. Freeman, después de despertar, no solo se encuentra con científicos heridos y/o muertos, sino también con la fauna de Xen que viajaron atreves de una brecha dimensional. Al ver la situación de emergencia en la que se encontraba no solo el sector, sino también todo Black Mesa, inmediatamente sube a la superficie abriéndose paso entre los Xenianos pero al llegar se encuentra con las fuerzas especiales H.E.C.U. que están “silenciando” a todo el personal de Black Mesa y eliminar todas las pruebas del desastre. Al ver la situación, Freeman se mueve a través de todo Black Mesa para llegar al Complejo Lλmbda y cerrar la brecha dimensional antes de que se extienda por todo el mundo…Jugabilidad...Hλlf-Life es una verdadera obra maestra cuando nos referimos a él como un juego “Single Player”, el objetivo del juego es utilizar pensamientos lógicos y nuestro armamento para sobrevivir en un entorno lleno de enemigos con distintas habilidades, también hay situaciones en el que los puzzles (al menos en los primeros días) pueden llegar a ser un problema.Variedad...El arsenal del juego que es muy variado desde armas simples como la Crowbar, Clock 17, Mp5 y Spas 12, hasta armas potentes, tanto militares, experimentales y alienígenas. No es lo único en variación, también hay una gran cantidad de enemigos como los soldados H.E.C.U., las asesinas Blacks Ops, alienígenas de distintos tamaños y poderes e incluso los guardias de seguridad si llegas a causarle heridas intencionalmente. Y la música no se queda atrás, cada escenario tiene su propio ambiente musical que puede generar tensión o adrenalina en el jugador.Innovación...La interacción con los NPC, el modelado y sus animaciones, para su época, eran sorprendentes, a pesar de que en ciertos momentos pueden sufrir de glitches. Los gráficos de ese momento, los efectos de luces y sombras, diseños del entorno y la ambientación, Hacen que el jugador realmente sienta que está dentro del juego, esto es gracias a su motor GoldSrc, una versión modificada del motor Quake.Multijugador...El multijugador de Hλlf-Life tampoco ha quedado de lado, su gran variación de armas, los orificios de bala en las paredes, salpicaduras de sangre o mejor, despedazar los cuerpos de los jugadores, la posibilidad de crear servers dedicados, la gran variedad de mapas incluyendo los oficiales y los que fueron creados por la comunidad, los personajes para controlar aunque en este aspecto hay pocos, aun así el jugador puede agregar más personajes al multijugador aunque los demás jugadores no tendrán la posibilidad de verlo.Mods...Como último punto, el motor GoldSrc, es un motor fácilmente manipulable, tanto que se han creado  varios mods del juego, como los más conocidos como Counter-Strike y Team Fortress, hasta los más olvidados como Deathmatch Classic y Ricochet, aunque estos son mods oficiales, la comunidad ha creado gran variedades de mods como USS Darkstar, Azure Sheep y Sven Coop.Puntos Negativos...Los únicos puntos malos del juego son que en el viaje del inicio es muy largo, aunque esto se puede omitir con la consola, la poca variedad que hay con los aliados, que son solo un científico con cuatro modelos de personajes y un guardia de seguridad, las armas y enemigos de la versión βeta que no aparecieron ni siquiera en el multijugador, y el no incluir la campaña especial “Decay”, un modo de juego exclusivo de Play Station 2 que permite jugar con 2 científicas.GAMEPLAY:             SOUND:                HISTORY:               INNOVATION:★★★★★          ★★★★★          ★★★★★          ★★★★★DIFFICULTY:            GRAPHICS:              DURATION:             TOTAL:★★★✩✩          ★★★★★          ★★★★★          ★★★★★http://store.steampowered.com/app/70","4":"EizanAratoFujimaki","key":259,"index":259},{"0":"274980","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"I'd definitely recommend this game for people who want to expand their vocabulary, but there are a few things I'd like to point out.-While this is almost never required for romance languages, in Japanese, Chinese and Korean, words, Especially adjectives and verbs, can be synonymous but imply different things. This is almost always the case in Japanese, where verbs have transitive and intransitive forms, but this is not listed in the definition, only one form is presented. This means doing research on the word you'll find yourself using more will help you be more fluent in the long run.-So much katakana... I'd like to see really rare kanji forms of words, as they can appear in stories and some videogames (You know, like English games using the words, 'Thee', 'Thou', etc. They're rare because of their age, but they can still find a use in medieval style games!). In fact, I might prefer it that way as I want to learn as much words as possible and converting English to katakana is easy when you learn about how Japanese pronunciation works. Just add a note to say it's rare to avoid confusion.-Some objects are... Odd. I saw this red box and the definition said it was a piggy bank or something, I was confused until I saw a dial, which meant it was a safe. Maybe you should make objects cliched/stereotyped and exaggerated to help people understand with a quick glance.-It doesn't follow spaced repitition, so you can mash the replay button endlessly until you get yourself a star. If you're a serious learner, never press the replay button, as you just bring it back to your short term memory and fail to remember it the next few days, at least space the replays by an hour the *first* time you try it.-Lists make it too easy sometimes, avoid using them and just use the random button, as I found myself just clicking whatever's next to the last object I clicked on, as I was able to remember the next thing I added right after. This is a mnemonic that relies on the location of the object INGAME, so it doesn't really help you learn. If you really want to do lists, run around the whole house clicking random items and adding them to the list, avoiding any sort of order or pattern.And here's some tips for Japanese:-Avoid Romaji, in fact, do kanji, when you don't know a word, you don't know it, there's no improving your ability to decipher meaning from kanji, so just dive right into it. Do kana if you're really keen on learning pronunciation before reading, and want to do it really, really quickly. Same thing probably applies with Pinyin and Hanzi, but I haven't played  the Chinese version so I don't know if Pinyin is provided.-The dots that appear between kana when you look at how to read the kanji is important, memorise the kana in sections divided by the dots, and their associated kanji (e.g. (毎日 [まい＊にち] まい is 毎 and にち is 日)) This is important, words might have multiple readings, and you might get them wrong, but if you memorise at least ONE reading for the kanji, you can type it on a computer, and even get the correct reading by typing the kanji on a dictionary.-While katakana is easy when you know it well enough, sometimes it isn't, as you might say different versions of a word (E.g. Fairy Floss vs. Cotton Candy, (Well, it's neither when translated to Japanese, but you get my point!)) or it's just katakana but isn't based on English, (e.g. パン for bread). Either way, it's nice to learn a ton of katakana in this game as you get badges for it.Other than that, it's good as you'll find objects in an every day home, and the exploration stops you from being bored quickly, and most importantly:It makes you think of (and therefore associate the word you're learning with) objects and pictures, rather than the English translation, which means that you can achieve fluency which allows you to form sentences in the language you want in your head directly, rather than creating an English sentence, translating it to your wanted language, THEN saying, writing or expressing it.","4":"TeCool","key":260,"index":260},{"0":"202090","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"Best game ever, very little P2W, as all payable items actually can be detrimental to your playing skills, an expert who started with bad equipment will have more potential than a new player who uses very high level equipment, as he'll be used to it and fail really badly when there's an event that measures skill only and gives people similar equipment. Also, all high level equipment are sorted by level, so if you can't buy it with ingame currency, it means specialising isn't a very good idea until you get to a higher level. Payable items don't have this restriction, so very powerful equipment can be put in the hands of new players. Keep in mind that all equipment has a bonus, but an equal penalty, making it not \"powerful\" in a linear sense, but if you specialise in a way that suits your playstyle, it makes you more powerful (but doing this early can bar you from changing your strategy and trying new techniques.)In terms of gameplay, everyone is -mostly- equal, some more general and some more specialized, it depends mostly on skill. Some elements are more powerful than others, not statistically, but in usage and opportunities to cast with most effect.","4":"TeCool","key":261,"index":261},{"0":"339280","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"I don't know what all the negative reviewers are blabbing about, I think this game is really unique, as a player of HoN (Only a few days...), DoTA (Maybe only a few months?), LoL (Quite some time), I think Strife is as easy as LoL, not easier.There's also a lot of things in common with DoTA 2 and LoL, they introduce the same things, with a combination of different methods (Baron, Roshan, Cindara), but Strife adds odd things like out of combat regeneration, which I actually think is perfectly fine, all the actual problems lie in normal regeneration.This game has a LOT of potential if balanced right.The meta is a bit undeveloped, due to how supports can do around as much damage as the nukers, and mages can build enough tank items to work like one, but it IS unique in the fact that top and middle are duo lanes, while bottom is usually soloed.The biggest complaint I have, however, is Ray, Strife's Teemo.","4":"TeCool","key":262,"index":262},{"0":"314130","1":"2015","2":false,"3":"i decided to buy it as it had items I wanted, by I think buying them individually is actually cheaper, if someone can calculate the price and put it in the comments section, I'd be happy.Or angry.","4":"TeCool","key":263,"index":263},{"0":"570","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"Played for a bit...enjoyed it.

Plus you can take fall damage from sliding down slops so watch out- Loot Crates do spawn all around the map, and there's certain areas where good loot spawns.Loot mostly contains:WeaponsClothesAmmoHealthFinal:As i said the game is still in early access so not everything is in the game, but it still is a great game to playJust don't ♥♥♥♥ off a T-Rex, okay?

The game tries to make you feel good with this system of constant rewards and progression although it fails because you don't actually feel accomplished.-: No storyline, NONE.-: This game is repetitive, most of your objectives in this game are basically 'kill this and receive this' or... 'mine this and receive this'.  Due to there being no storyline you find yourself asking 'why am I even doing this?!'.-: No actual quests, you have a pre-determined set of quests that every player in the entire game is also doing. You have no freedom to do what you want (that is if you want to actually make progress within the game), you MUST complete the assigned quest to move onto the next one.-: The  entire game  is randomly generated making there feel like there's nothing to actually explore, it's just randomly generated terrain and dungeons (that also seem to be very repetitive). -: You must make an account for the game itself, this isn't so bad on its own however it can be very frustrating trying to get your verification code from your email to work (both me and my friend had the problem).-: Character customization itself is bad, (not the hats, there's plenty of those). there aren't many color options, as far as physical traits just about all you can do is change your skin color (e.g. you cannot change your height, width, etc.).-: Things in the tutorial seem to be out of order, for example around my first hour of gameplay I was being being told the buttons used to attack even though I had already killed loads of enemies.-: Does not have very much music.-: All drops are marked as uncommon/rare+ when it comes to the rarity tag of an item, I've never seen a single item marked as 'common'. I feel the game does this to make you feel more accomplished.This game has/had a lot of potential, it really did.

ORIGINAL REVIEW BY        FlyAwayNow        http://steamcommunity.com//id/FlyAwayNow/","4":"H1DD3NT3RR0R","key":346,"index":346},{"0":"105600","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"To commemorate tha beta of Steam Reviews, it only make sense dat I finally write a recommendation fo' a game dat has been close ta mah ♥♥♥ since tha dizzle I was first introduced ta it: Terraria.Terraria has proven ta be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of funk ta play, n' has been one of mah freshest vizzle game time sinks up in recent mutha♥♥♥♥in years cuz of dat ♥♥♥♥. Between lenient system requirements, a solid (albeit imbalanced, at times) combat system, a funky-♥♥♥ broad permittizzle fo' exploration n' a wide selection of buildin decor, itz tha type of game dat strikes me as havin suttin' fo' everyone. Which is good, when you consider dat it also has multiplayer n' ♥♥♥♥. Even mo' betta when you git ta tha late game, which has a wide array of weapons, armors n' tools ta allow fo' a wide variety of specializations.Buildin n' exploration is phat points up in favor of tha game yo, but tha gameplay mechanics is suttin' I'd like ta single up fo' praise. For a 2D game, its combat system has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of spectacle, n' like thatz part of why I find it so charmin yo. Hurtin enemies--even dem playas whoz ♥♥♥ is vastly inferior ta you--feels good. Y'all KNOW dat ♥♥♥♥, mutha♥♥♥♥a! I be fly as a gangbangin' falcon, soarin all up in tha sky dawwwwg! It aint nuthin but satisfyin ta hear tha hit sound on tha mo' squishy enemies, n' peep dem explode tha ♥♥♥♥ into fine lil chunks when they take a thugged-out dirt nap. Ground movement could be mo' betta yo, but certain late game ♥♥♥♥ hit you wit tha mobilitizzle ta dash n' fly, which straight-up expand how tha ♥♥♥♥ you can explore n' fight fo' realz. And wit a wide selection of weapons, every last mutha♥♥♥♥in playa is bound ta find a rosta of tools, spells n' fish-related artillery dat fits they playstyle.Da game aint without flaws, mind yo thugged-out ♥♥♥. With tha gamez update history, tha launch endgame now vastly differs from dat of tha current one. This has hustled ta some balizzle n' progression issues, da most thugged-out glarin of which bein how tha ♥♥♥♥ sluggish tha early game feels. Well shiiiit, it worries me dat tha start of tha game might dissuade some playas from playing, when they might ludd what tha ♥♥♥♥ tha late game has ta offer n' ♥♥♥♥. Da game also has a wack g-thang of recyclin mob AI wit reskins, though dis be averted by adjustin certain parametas n' givin dem unique abilitizzles ta hide tha fact. Even though I have mo' ta say bout tha shortcomings, there be a just too much phat up in tha game ta stay mad bout what tha ♥♥♥♥ effectively boils down ta nitpicking.Plus, it has hats fo' realz. Any game dat has a selection of basebizzle caps gets brownie points.Watch some trailers. Read some other props. If dis be lookin like suttin' you'd be interested in, then take it from me: give Terraria a cold-♥♥♥ lil chance. Da game occasionally goes on sale fo' 75% off, so pick up a gangbangin' four pack fo' yo ♥♥♥ n' three playas. If I be wrong, then I cost you a meal at Subway--not subliminal advertising--and I be sorry as a mutha♥♥♥♥a bout dat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. But if I be right, then it'll be well worth tha price. We sposed ta ♥♥♥♥in pay $60 these minutes fo' a gangbangin' fulfillin gamin experience. This is one that'll run you $10, at most.

Not only the graphics, even though 2D they are polished and very nice. The wide range of playeble characters (called Nauts), there is a Naut to suit Anyone. Awesomenauts is basically 2D Dota, Basically. With the Nice cartoon like graphics and a massive online community where you can share ideas for the devs to look at and discuss, share Naut build and since it is a indie game, the developers actually READ the suggestions and therefore making the game a better experience for everyone!

Yo ♥♥♥ must help yo' character learn how tha ♥♥♥♥ ta control they glocks while cappin' enemies. Put ya mutha♥♥♥♥in choppers up if ya feel dis! Right back up in yo mutha♥♥♥♥in ♥♥♥. Strangely, each character has tha mysterious juice ta fire one or two shots without wack recoil by straight-up briefly jerkin up in tha opposite direction they is movin in. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy ♥♥♥♥♥♥. When yo' character wears a Kevlar vest, every last mutha♥♥♥♥in part of yo' character, except tha head, is made outta steel.

This can be buggin at first yo, but yo big-♥♥♥ booty is ghon soon git used ta blastin a lil' small-♥♥♥ smudge of pixels on top of a cold-♥♥♥ lil characterz body. Da Goddess of Guns can materialize glocks up in yo' characterz handz all dem secondz before a round starts, n' you can put dat on yo' toast. But ♥♥♥♥ dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat yo' character must pay fo' tha guns, which have vastly overinflated prices.

Mo' advanced playas can make glocks materialize outta thin air wit they mind as long as they have tha right amount of scrilla.Maps is often bout evil terrorists tryin ta take a thugged-out dump on deserted places. Vandalizzle be a straight-up straight-up crime up in tha Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists is deployed ta stop em. Unfortunately fo' tha Terrorists, they is dumb n' only packed one bomb. But ♥♥♥♥ dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat tha Counter-Terrorists do not know how tha ♥♥♥♥ ta pick up a thugged-out dropped bomb, so tha Terrorists can still pick it up afta it is dropped by a gangbangin' fallen playa.In some maps, tha terrorists have kidnapped a janitor n' low-level desk jockey up in a funky-♥♥♥ building. Da Counter-Terrorists done been deployed ta save one, not both, of tha hostages. In reality, dis is just a thinly-veiled excuse fo' tha CTs ta cappin' tha Terrorists while pumpin roundz tha ♥♥♥♥ into tha invincible hostages. One weird thang bout hostage maps is dat you can purchase a \"Hostage Rescue Kit\", which somehow make gives you tha mobilitizzle ta put a grown playa on yo' shouldaz up in a second. Y'all KNOW dat ♥♥♥♥, mutha♥♥♥♥a! Perhaps it aint nuthin but a spell scroll dat allows hostages ta hover ta yo' characterz shoulders. Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive be a surprisingly solid game bout playas wit da most thugged-out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ glock handlin abilitizzles eva peeped on Earth. Even though yo' charactas have tha aimin abilitizzlez of one of mah thugs wit Parkinsons Disease, you have nuff tactical options dat make tha game straight-up funk n' dynamic.

Been a Wolfenstein fan from childhood.Machine Games has managed to mix modern shooter features with the old for a very convincing experience. Solid story line and character development, Wolfenstein NO brings the FPS genre backs to its roots with fast pace action based around combat intensity, excitement and less hyper realism that has overtaken the entire genre as of late. No more ducking for cover every five seconds to regenerate your health. Wolfenstein NO makes good use of HP and Armour pick ups that allows the player to feel more apart of the story rather than just a bystander.I can't rave enough about the gun play in this game, amazing gun selection and design, almost every weapon can be dual-wielded. A good variety of weapons that all have different uses which help foster and encourage different play styles eg. stealth or open combat. This game has put to rest the argument that every FPS must embrace a multiplayer feature. While I hope due to the success of Wolfenstein NO a standalone multiplayer is developed in the future that echos the Enemy Territory model of earlier Wolfenstein games, this game easily stands tall on its singleplayer features alone.With multiple difficulties, different characters and a meaningful collectibles feature that unlocks four very unique gameplay modes, this game has plenty of replay-ability and could easily be enjoyed for many playthroughs. I don't normally like DLC but I really hope this game gets some side mission or extended story line DLC and fingers crossed a sequel in the coming year or two.Hats off to Machine Games for crafting an enjoyable singleplayer FPS in an era where everyone is obsessed with multiplayer and for standing by their development goals till completion to produce a solid product. Props also to Bethesda for backing a  studio with great talent and vision.

But out of the the costumising you will ever do is your mask whcich defines who you are with over 100 mask to choose from and over 100 different colours and patterns no one ever has the same mask.But all up its a very enjoyable game stealth, loud, with or without friends it dosen't matter the circumstances its a great game for those who enjoy co-op strategic shooter i recomend it to all for only 30 dollars its a great pick up. Yes i know i only have 6 hours on the game when i wrote this review but when the game first came out i played the hell out of it in XBOX 360","4":"imsojipper","key":394,"index":394},{"0":"206420","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"ผมเล่นไม่ได้ช่วยหน่อยครับ","4":"76561198084542731","key":395,"index":395},{"0":"47790","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"เป็นเกมที่สมจริงที่สุดเท่าทีเคยเล่นมา และเป็นเกมส์ที่ให้ข้อคิดเป็นดีที่สุด และให้เห็นความลำบาก ของทหาร อมเริกา ในแต่ละหน่อย ของ แต่ละกอง ทัพ ที่พวกเขา ได้ ฝ่าฝัน อุปสรรค ต่าง ๆ มากมาย ซึ้งเกมนี้จะให้ ขอคิด ในด่านท้ายๆ  ที่จะให้ผู้เล่น ได้ยิง กับ ผู้ก่อการร้าย ซึ่งทำให้ คุณภาพ ของปืน ในแต่ละ ด่าน ซึ่ง จะ สุ่มออก ไป และ อัพเกรดได้(มั้ง) แต่ มี อีกจุดนึงที่ ผม ชอบเป็นที่สุด มันจะมีด่านนึงที่ให้เราไปช่วยเพื่อนของ อีกหน่อย ซึ่งในด่านสุดท้าย จะเปลี่ยนไปอีกแนวนึง ๆ ได้ด้วย การใช้ RPG บุกเข้าไปในด่านนั้น ๆ ซึ่งจะมีอาวุธของทหาร อเมิรกา ในด่านๆ นั้น เอง ซึ่งด่านๆ นึง ต้องใช้ความแม่น ในอีกระดับนึกของผู้เล่น ทั้งฝ่าย และใช้ ความแม่นย่ำ ต่าง ๆ ใน แต่ละ ปืน จะแตกต่างกัน ออกไป ซึ่ง แบ่ง เป็น หน่วยๆ เช่น หน่วยซุ่มยิงก็จะมีสไนเปอร์เป็นปืนหลัก หน่วย ทหาร ลาดตะเวน ก็จะมี ปืน MP7 เป็นปืนหลัก และหน่อย ทหาร ราบ ก็จะใช้ อาวุธหนัก ไปตามๆ หน่วย ในเรื่องของภาพ ก็สวยไปอีกแบบนึง แต่ก็จะมี บัคเล็กน้อย ในด่าน เกือบท้าย ๆ และขอจบ ในการ ริวิว แค่นี้ สนับสนุนให้เล่นเกมส์แท้  ขอบคุณครัชชช :3 .","4":"76561198084542731","key":396,"index":396},{"0":"570","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"Good teamwork game but most of the time there will ALWAYS be someone that will not listen or cooperate with team thus leading team to losing the game.

It ruins the experience if your constantly finding bugs that may be small still ruin things or make the game frustrating. Another major concern i have is that you need a pretty damn good rig in order to run this, i can usually run all my games (Steam and non-steam) at their highest settings, ARK however for whatever reason i have severe trouble to run on even its lowest settings. Now i know some of you will go \"Get a better rig\" well that doesn't solve much as it is the job of the Dev team to make the game accessible to as many people as they can, and in order to do that they need to get on top of fixing and optimising the game rather than adding more features. so no i can't reccommend the game IN ITS CURRENT STATE, however if the Dev team is able to address the many issues with this game and do something simmilar to what Space Engineers is doing right now, where the devs arehalting addition of features and are just focusing on fixing the current bugs, then i'd give it a positive review...","4":"AlpacaRevolution","key":523,"index":523},{"0":"205100","1":"2013","2":true,"3":"This game has one of the bests assassins in gaming history its not just his looks it his powers they arrange from time stopping teleporting and seeing through walls one of the best games ive ever played 10/10","4":"76561198071952798","key":524,"index":524},{"0":"570","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"10/10report brazil, Russia and South east Asia for feeding.","4":"76561198009001563","key":525,"index":525},{"0":"271290","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"Unbelivably fun.","4":"76561198016753953","key":526,"index":526},{"0":"570","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"why get league of legends?","4":"76561198016753953","key":527,"index":527},{"0":"346010","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"for an incomplete game to provide this much creativity and fun. cant wait for full release .","4":"smegmyfoodle","key":528,"index":528},{"0":"239250","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"the best aspect of the game in my opinion is being dracula himself. you never get tired of running around feeling like a badass. the game does have some negative aspects which completly changes gameplay to the point of it being another game entirely ( i.e sneaking around guards you can never ever kill...). the combat beats gods of war in my opinion.","4":"smegmyfoodle","key":529,"index":529},{"0":"313120","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"This is a beautiful Game, but if it was co-op it would make it so much more enjoyable.","4":"76561198057869849","key":530,"index":530},{"0":"211820","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"Awesome game, Looking forward to more content.","4":"76561198058836921","key":531,"index":531},{"0":"218620","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"A half broken game, that i can't stop playing!","4":"lol_ursuchanoob","key":532,"index":532},{"0":"12210","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"Terrible pc port, terrible frame rates, frustrating mechanics...

This game offers very little new content, with half the assassins ending up being overshadowed side mission that don't do the characters justice.The game itself is still quite good, with most of the core mechanics remaining the same. Movements, expecially grappling and gliding are a little off, and the combat (with the City approach of 'more guys = harder) starts to show it's flaws when surrounded by 20+ enemies.Overall, this game still has a very solid core to it, and should definitely be played. Yes, it is the weakest in the series, but that is because the first two were so strong. Some of the elements of this game are nicely done, just pretend multiplayer doesn't exist though. Writing (although I personally did not like the story) is quite nicely done, and everything about this game still holds it's own.The weakest part of this game is that it is the third in a series, and it is definitely a step backwards. If this was a first up game, we would still highlight the flaws but could see the room for improvment. The sad fact is that there have been two games already that have overall been better. But I do encourage you to play this game, because it is still the same engine and gameplay as the first two - and that is still a damn good thing.","4":"AMV72","key":538,"index":538},{"0":"218060","1":"2013","2":true,"3":"Taking every element from the preivous Runner titles, Runner2 offers an experience that flows wonderfully together. With over 100 levels, dozens of unlockables, lovely visuals and a wonderful soundtrack this game is a really delight to play.The premise is simple: get from one end of the level to the other in a free-flowing smooth run. But this game is not for the people who have slow reactions times or get frustrated easily. It is hard, and quite unforgiving. Repetition is going to happening in this game, but because of the quick reload and charming music, it's hard to feel put out.When you do get a great run going, it's fantastic. All the notes and melodies stiched together with your actions makes it a grand way to know you're doing well. Not to mention that it also helps timing your moments with the logical note progression.Over the multiple different worlds, there are retro levels, multiple paths and different bosses to change things up, and the dastardly combinations of different moments makes you really appreciate the level design - which may appear simplistic at times - but it very finely tuned.This game is great in short bursts for those that don't have much time, it's great for those wanting a challenge, and especially if you like the recognition for seamlessly stringing together your levels and actions. Everything about this game screams that the developer cared about making their game. From the cutscenes narrated by Charles Martinet (who also does the voice for Mario) right down to the charming animations and fluid movement.This game is something you should seriously consider purchasing, playing, loving and then realising that you have to do the whole game on all three difficulties and then all the extras and then costumes and then...","4":"AMV72","key":539,"index":539},{"0":"24240","1":"2012","2":true,"3":"First you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the women.By taking all of them by force with guns.","4":"AMV72","key":540,"index":540},{"0":"440","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"Great Game While It Lasted","4":"76561198069170979","key":541,"index":541},{"0":"730","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"kinda gets boring overtime but ok!","4":"76561198132540690","key":542,"index":542},{"0":"220200","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"Best Game Ever!!!!!!","4":"76561198132540690","key":543,"index":543},{"0":"113020","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"*Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.*","4":"711armageddoncarmageddon","key":544,"index":544},{"0":"105600","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"Maps usually end up having more signs than ♥♥♥♥ing Las Vegas.","4":"711armageddoncarmageddon","key":545,"index":545},{"0":"9480","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"I've created better roleplaying characters than half of Gmod's community has.","4":"711armageddoncarmageddon","key":546,"index":546},{"0":"22230","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"Hade me lost for words. 10/10 game. just buy it allready","4":"Andraison","key":547,"index":547},{"0":"203770","1":"2013","2":true,"3":"one of the best in depth stratergy game i have ever played big learning curve but a tone of fun to play so.....

If you’re looking to have fun with mate or just by yourself, play, BF4, COD (Not ghost) or B2. I found that the actual shooters elements of the game is dull. Yeah, you got skyhooks and things around you, which are very handy, but the amount of enemies I had to face was annoying and at times, boring. You also can only have 2 weapons at a time. But what I did like was the power ups, which all had different uses. But for half the game I used like 2 of them, which I think they're is like over 7 or something. So why is this game so good? This game really shines, and is utterly unbeaten, with its engaging storyline. What a story, I never thought a game could engage me and make me care about the characters like this. I kept pushing on the average shooter because of this story. Also, there is a lot of freedom for the play, or as it seems. The graphics is more than good and the city is really awesome to, which you get to explore bits and pieces of the downtown dark alley ways to the wealth and good looking streets, parks, houses and more. So overall, this game is a masterpiece in its own right, and has defiantly set a new started in terms of storytelling games. (P.S.

(Yes, that was a pun).2. It was based on one of the coolest games in the VR Universe, Time Rifters. To be based in the same scenery is a lovely trip to your brains memory compartment, if you haven't seen that game, then it's just a cool place to be in general.3. Its got great progression! Not at one point did I feel It was going too fast or too slow, and when I needed money the most, a Rainbow Money Ball would come along and help me out!So in total this is the greatest Clicker/Idle/Shooter of all time!

You can also  lvl up  geometry skill which will allow you to mine higher lvl rocks and get more resorces from them, as far as pvp goes i have yet to try it out. I find that melee is a good skill to start lvling up right away because it can become handy later on, also the quest system is nice filled with different varieties and you never feel as if you have done the same quest more that twice.The map is HUGE and would take hours to explore and going out past a certain point you will find that enemies will get tougher very quickly which will force you to lvl up before exploring more which is good because when you die from a hard enemy and then go lvl up a little bit when you go back to that same enemy you feel like you are getting stronger and making progress towards you'r character.

Well I'm in it so it's guaranteed to be epic. All jokes aside though the game is awesome, and you can read my review to know more.The game overall is awesome, it's like borderlands 2, but it's better. The Scaling in BL2, was horrible from level 50 upwards. You need OP and Gamebreaking gear to get anywhere in the game fomr UVHM onwards. And I can already see the scaling in this game is a lot better. I'm able to now use Purple guns to defeat a raid boss, solo. The visuals, can be a little repetitive at times, but overall they are appealing and does bring different environments into the game. Now as for gameplay, well, many, including me who had seen the gameplay, thought that the butt-stomp ability would be a gimmick in the game that I would never use. I was wrong. It adds so much more to the combat, in addition with the low gravity, killing is a lot more fluid, getting around on foot isn't so boresome, and depending on how you use your \"double jump\", and where you activate the extra boost, gives completely different outcomes. For example, if I need to get to a higher ledge, a jump and boost when i'm halfway until the fulcrum of my jump, giving me a way higher jump. But If I was to say get passed a very wide crevice I would start sprinting, jump then activate the boost before I start descending. And this all may seem simple, but it can be applied to the combat maneuvres and it overall makes combat more pleasing. I particularly like to use the second descripted type of jump a lot when traversing without a vehicle, it practically triples my movement time and comes in handy, even in the normal gravity environments, such as Helios.Now for Classes. Of course everyone started the game as claptrap, so i'm going to go and do something different like I usually do, I played the game as Nisha, speccing into her middle and right trees, and found myself being basically a god, maybe here is where the teamwork really comes into play. Having all 4 Nisha's running around wouldn't work, because you have no way of healing or buffing teammates. Nisha is a very combat centred solo class. And I would say she is needed for every kind of boss fight, she deals damage and deals it where it matters. Claptrap, is a must have, he gives the team random buffs, and helps out alot with co-op, lots of health boosts, dmg boosts etc. Athena plays the role of the tank healer, she is a great class to play as with friends, although solo not so much. Her abilities are a lot like Maya's except she soaks up damage. She is also a vital part to the team, giving out lots of Health regen. I didn't play wilhelm much, but from what I did, He is just a straight up tank class. He takes all of the damage dealt while dealing a fair enough amount of damage. He is the most Balanced class from what i've played of him but isn't very fun (for lack of better term), So overall the classes have their own Pros and cons and they all do their own special thing that makes them vital to the team.As an overall, I'd say the game does use lots of content from Borderlands 2, including some legendaries and renamed Unique guns. The humour is a step up from Borderlands 2 and as an Australian I did get all of the jokes, so that could be a downside for some players who don't know much of Australian slang and colloquialism. But yes, the humour is well done and implemented, the story is EXCELLENT. I love it. *No spoilers* I hate lilith for what she did to jack, and I empathised for Jack as the hours passed. Some of the negative reviews here state that the campaign didn't give enough XP to get to the required levels, but that's because they didn't do the side missions, which were frankly better this time around. There is a lot more variety and SO MUCH story to be told in the side missions, like how Terramorphous made it onto Pandora, when Threshers where only a Moon Species (DAMN YOU HAMMERLOCK), or how Jack comes up with the idea of Moonshotting loaders to Pandora etc. Lots of things storywise are excellent, with a nice twist on Jack at the end and how he gets the scar on his face. The story just blew my mind the first time around, and I stuck around long enough for 3 more playthroughs up to TVHM and still find it enjoyable. I especially can't wait for the UVHM pack that will have a new Narrative Voice over along with Tiny Tina. Overall Game was excellent.Now for a short list of Pros and Cons incase you don't want to read all that garbage.Pros:- Story- Classes- Visuals- Soundtrack- Gameplay- Combat- Low Gravity- Enemy Scaling- Weapon Scaling- Replayability (I'd die if I didn't put that in there)Cons:- Nisha and Claptrap are the only 2 classes that are really enjoyable in SP and MP- Wilhelm and Athena lack enough SP Skills to play SP, but are both great for MP- Not as many legendaries- Maybe too many reused Borderlands 2 Assets- Comedy can get a little dry after a whileAnyway that's my Review of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel I give this game an overall of:8.7/10. It's more of the same which isn't bad, it still has that Borderlands Charm, it delivers where in lots of ways Borderlands 2 failed. And even though it seems mediocre amongst many giants coming out this year, it's defenitely my Game of the Year. I can't wait for the Doppelganger Pack release tomorrow, and like i've said many many times. This game overall is excellents. It's a must buy for borderlands fans, and a must buy if you want to try out the series. TL;DR Game overall is excellent, more of the same Borderlands you love while changing it up a bit. New players will love it, while old fans will cherish it.","4":"bohgeraltofrivia","key":720,"index":720},{"0":"730","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)﻿","4":"TeH-B-Rad","key":721,"index":721},{"0":"440","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"Best hat simulator on the market.14/10 would waste my time again.","4":"TeH-B-Rad","key":722,"index":722},{"0":"221100","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"Play COD noobs, \"All your beanz belong to us.\"","4":"BAW_Killer","key":723,"index":723},{"0":"287700","1":"2015","2":false,"3":"I have to down vote this game.

Thus, Rust had nothing more to offer for me and I completely stopped playing it.- EARLY EARLY ACCESS REVIEW -Rust well.. It's different.It may be in Alpha but it's already such a great game, I'm excited and dreading new updates, I love the way it is at the moment, not knowing if the upcoming developments will ruin what i think or make it even better, going to have to wait and find out, I spend most of my time playing this game, Surely enough playing on a populated server isn't a good idea, it'll ruin your experience all together, the key is to find a decent server with only about 20-40 people online, i'd say start off with a pve until you get the hang of things. Also playing on Official servers aren't exactly the best idea.Wolves and bears have a fair amount of health compared to the zombies, bears and wolves you have to avoid until you have a bow or a gun, zombies you can take on with a pickaxe etc. This is a great game and definitely worth the money, considering it's in Alpha, it's damn well good.I thought it'd be one of those games that look great but turn out pretty bad, Looks great, is great.The only downer for me is the fact it over heats my laptop, and that's when I play with Render Quality 0, and run it on the fastest option. The graphics are great.. but I can't really play with them. I have a decent gaming laptop.. but still It overheats so I have to take breaks and I don't like that.All in all, Great game, definitely worth a look at :)I'm sure more people would buy it if there was a demo, then again it's in alpha and only $20, Still worth a look :)I surely don't regret this game and I won't anytime soon =D","4":"Infixation","key":778,"index":778},{"0":"203160","1":"2013","2":true,"3":"Tomb Raider is amazing, It's my favourite game by far.

Each class on each team has access to different guns, attachments etc. And you have a set amount of equipment tokens/points to spend on your loadout. You also have a weight meter which can determine whether your loadout will make you run fast or slow, and how fast your stamina will run out.Now lets get into the combat:The combat is fast paced at times and slow paced at others, you will constantly find yourself having to visually inspect whether you have killed a person and wondering \"should i check or should i run past and hope the enemy is dead\". From the last sentence you probably can tell the game is going to be realistic. It is. If you move up on your own your playing a wild card, instead you might want to call out a couple of your teammates to help you complete/capture an objective (Yes, there are a lot of different gamemodes to choose from, most of which include control areas). There is virtually no HUD (Heads Up Display), the only things that do show up on the hud is how many magazines you have, and info about the objective(s). The gunplay is realistic, recoil is a thing and attachments can supress that recoil but also you can by swithing modes on your gun or burst firing. 1-2 bullets from most guns can take down an enemy.Lets talk graphics:The graphics in the game are not spectactular, but still enough to immerse you in the gameplay, though the design and textures on the weapons look great. You can't really expect a game run and made on the source engine  and is only slightly modified is going to get you amazing Battlefield graphics.Overall Gameplay:The gameplay is realistic, tense and rewarding if you play the game right, what a mordern military shooter should be, it offers great and realistic gunplay, a variety of gamemodes and maps. Insurgency will keep you coming back to play some more (also teamwork is a thing in this game).","4":"76561198057389499","key":831,"index":831},{"0":"252950","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"Great banter has been had while playing this game. 10/10 would play again.BTW ONLY PLAY WITH CONTROLLLER PC CONTROLS ARE ♥♥♥♥","4":"76561198057389499","key":832,"index":832},{"0":"4000","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"played around with the ♥♥♥♥ model on the workshop.its ok","4":"76561198057389499","key":833,"index":833},{"0":"440","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"Nice Game, good work GabeN","4":"76561198057389499","key":834,"index":834},{"0":"237930","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"Finished it again and again.

When you first start playing things can seem a bit overwhelming and especially if you're playing online not everyone is forgiving towards new players, but its definately easier to complete jobs online than with bots offline. the only thing that was disappointing was that its alot more work to create custom masks than i feel its worth, you need any combination of 3 components to make one: material, pattern, and paint. and the only way to get anyone of these at a time is as a random drop at the end of each completed mission, but you also have the chance of getting bonus cash, bonus xp, or a weapon mod (mods that you have to pay ludicrous amounts for to then actually use anyway, so thats another thing), but overall its an exellent game and highly recomended. dont feel bad if you're a lpw level, it doesnt take long to level up online and doing more difficult jobs with higher level plays who can carry you through jobs.","4":"76561198027225504","key":877,"index":877},{"0":"323470","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"Trained under Frieza as a Frieza-race, Wore Goku's Gi, got threatend by Frieza, then got hit on by Frieza.10/10 would emotionally conflict Frieza again.","4":"76561198027225504","key":878,"index":878},{"0":"271290","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"bought it, love it. i invested in the nemesis bundle because i was afraid that i'd get stuck with a lame default mech, but the fact of the matter is it doesnt matter what mech you use, you can still win. i wouldnt use the term \"pay to win\" but if you're willing to put in some cash it grants you quicker access to some weapons and perks than having to play for hours on end. the only thins you have to pay for are the cosmetics, everything that affects gameplay can be acheived by earning HC (Hawken Credits) which you get based more on play time than anything else, but you can increase the amount slightly by achieving a higher score in any given game mode. there is only one thing i think could be changed, i just feel like everythings a bit over priced when it comes to using the HC, its better than a lot of other games that have a dual currency system, but it could be better, especially since when you spend 3000 credits on a perk that only works on the mech you bought it for.

And the devs didnt even refund those who lost their hard earned robots.The development team needs to recognise that what they are/have done has turned a great oppurtunity into a train wreck. This CAN CLEARLY BE SEEN IN REVIEWS. Unless drastic restorations to the game are conducted. YOU WILL NOT ENJOY THIS GAME.","4":"76561198079326390","key":949,"index":949},{"0":"292030","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"I saw a naked woman","4":"76561198142749308","key":950,"index":950},{"0":"298110","1":"2014","2":true,"3":"Had my eyeballs gouged out by an eagle, before being killed by a rhino.

The stealth is way to easy aswell like orcs are just way too stupid and the attract button makes the game way to easy.  The nemesis system is good either having like your own army withing the system or let the orcs fight themselves within the system and see how they progress within the army. Final verdict its alot of fun! messing around with the orcs the brutal final blow kills are brutal! and having to choose to stealth or run in like a maniac always keeps the game fun and entertaining i was just dissapointed with the story of the game.","4":"gusvu","key":981,"index":981},{"0":"374301","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"\"Hey control Barney destroyed the bathroom....again\"10000000000000000000/10","4":"Punixa","key":982,"index":982},{"0":"366660","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"É DO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥COMPRA LOGO FDP","4":"Punixa","key":983,"index":983},{"0":"207140","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"se vc gosta de correr e jogar com o PAYDAY gang esse jogo é pra vcGOTTA GO FAST","4":"Punixa","key":984,"index":984},{"0":"259080","1":"2013","2":true,"3":"♥♥♥♥","4":"Punixa","key":985,"index":985},{"0":"302590","1":"2015","2":true,"3":"A really fun and addicting game to play. a bit unbalanced at  the moment (its much easier to win as thief) but still really cool it does take a while to get the hang of.","4":"76561198044402508","key":986,"index":986},{"0":"242880","1":"2013","2":true,"3":"Sir, You Are Being Hunted is a very \"pretty\" game, with a mix of thrill, horror and humour.

You can choose out of 6 races (or 7 if you have dlc) and can the play on two different maps. You play with three different people and as you gain more experience you can make your character stronger by giving him armor, weapons, and traits and abilities.
